##### Latest Released Version v3.0.5.
For all releases see https://github.com/wso2/siddhi/releases

Siddhi CEP is a lightweight, easy-to-use Open Source Complex Event Processing Engine (CEP) released as a Java Library under Apache Software License v2.0. Siddhi CEP processes events which are generated by various event sources, analyses them and notifies appropriate complex events according to the user specified queries.

This project was initiated as a research project at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, and now being improved by WSO2 Inc.
