Siddhi Complex Event Processing Engine 
======================================

Siddhi CEP is a lightweight, easy-to-use Open Source Complex Event Processing Engine (CEP) released as a Java Library under Apache Software License v2.0. Siddhi CEP process events generated by various event sources, analyze them and notifies appropriate complex events according to the user specified queries.

This project was initiated as a research project at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, and now being improved by [WSO2 Inc](http://wso2.com/). 

**Active development version of Siddhi** : **v4.0.0**  _built on Java 8._
