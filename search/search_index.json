The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause. Syntax session(<INT|LONG|TIME> window.session, <STRING> window.key, <INT|LONG|TIME> window.allowedlatency) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.session The time period for which the session considered is valid.

The time period specified here should be less than the session time gap (which is specified via the 'window.session' parameter). 0 INT LONG TIME Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 define stream PurchaseEventStream (user string, item_number int, price float, quantity int); @info(name='query0) from PurchaseEventStream#window.session(5 sec, user, 2 sec) select * insert all events into OutputStream; This query processes events that arrive at the PurchaseEvent input stream. The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order. Syntax sort(<INT> window.length, <STRING> attribute, <STRING> order) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.length The size of the window length. INT No No attribute The attribute that should be checked for the order. The concatenation of all the attributes of the event is considered. STRING Yes No order The order define as \"asc\" or \"desc\". asc STRING Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 define stream cseEventStream (symbol string, price float, volume long); define window cseEventWindow (symbol string, price float, volume long) sort(2,volume, 'asc'); @info(name = 'query0') from cseEventStream insert into cseEventWindow; @info(name = 'query1') from cseEventWindow select volume insert all events into outputStream ; sort(5, price, 'asc') keeps the events sorted by price in the ascending order. Therefore, at any given time, the window contains the 5 lowest prices. time (Window) A sliding time window that holds events that arrived during the last windowTime period at a given time, and gets updated for each event arrival and expiry.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order. Syntax sort(<INT> window.length, <STRING> attribute, <STRING> order) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.length The size of the window length.

A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause. Syntax session(<INT|LONG|TIME> window.session, <STRING> window.key, <INT|LONG|TIME> window.allowedlatency) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.session The time period for which the session considered is valid.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. There can be out of order and late arrival of events, these events can arrive after the session is expired, to include those events to the matching session key specify a latency time period that is less than the session gap period.To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.
