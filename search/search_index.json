Happy documenting with Google Season of Docs! Proposal 1: CI/CD Guideline for Siddhi Stream Processor Description Siddhi is an open source cloud native stream processing engine [1]. The Siddhi engine is integrated with various other open source and proprietary projects such as Apache Eagle [1], Apache Flink [2], UBER [3] and Punch Platform [4] and etc. Other than that, the Siddhi engine also plays the primary role in various WSO2 products such as WSO2 Stream Processor, WSO2 Data Analytics Server, WSO2 API Manager (Traffic Manager component), etc. Siddhi Query Language is an SQL-like query language that defines a logic for analyzing high volumes of data generated in high speed and in real time. Siddhi documentation [2] currently describes the Siddhi architecture, main concepts, features, the Siddhi grammar, and how to use it. However, at present, we lack proper documentation to explain the complete life cycle of the CI-CD process. We need detailed and comprehensive documentation that explains this process. When writing this documentation, you are also expected to try out the product and gather some user experience around it and make sure that it is captured properly in the documentation.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause. Syntax session( INT|LONG|TIME window.session, STRING window.key, INT|LONG|TIME window.allowedlatency) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.session The time period for which the session considered is valid. This is specified in seconds, minutes, or milliseconds (i.e., 'min', 'sec', or 'ms'.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order. Syntax sort( INT window.length, STRING attribute, STRING order) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.length The size of the window length. INT No No attribute The attribute that should be checked for the order. The concatenation of all the attributes of the event is considered.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause. Syntax session( INT|LONG|TIME window.session, STRING window.key, INT|LONG|TIME window.allowedlatency) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.session The time period for which the session considered is valid. This is specified in seconds, minutes, or milliseconds (i.e., 'min', 'sec', or 'ms'.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order. Syntax sort( INT window.length, STRING attribute, STRING order) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.length The size of the window length.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause. Syntax session( INT|LONG|TIME window.session, STRING window.key, INT|LONG|TIME window.allowedlatency) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.session The time period for which the session considered is valid. This is specified in seconds, minutes, or milliseconds (i.e., 'min', 'sec', or 'ms'.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order. Syntax sort( INT window.length, STRING attribute, STRING order) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.length The size of the window length. INT No No attribute The attribute that should be checked for the order. The concatenation of all the attributes of the event is considered.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause. Syntax session( INT|LONG|TIME window.session, STRING window.key, INT|LONG|TIME window.allowedlatency) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.session The time period for which the session considered is valid. This is specified in seconds, minutes, or milliseconds (i.e., 'min', 'sec', or 'ms'.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order. Syntax sort( INT window.length, STRING attribute, STRING order) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.length The size of the window length.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order.

A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause. Syntax session( INT|LONG|TIME window.session, STRING window.key, INT|LONG|TIME window.allowedlatency) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.session The time period for which the session considered is valid. This is specified in seconds, minutes, or milliseconds (i.e., 'min', 'sec', or 'ms'.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name.","title":"session (Window)"},{"location":"api/4.5.11/#sort-window","text":"This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause. Syntax session( INT|LONG|TIME window.session, STRING window.key, INT|LONG|TIME window.allowedlatency) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.session The time period for which the session considered is valid. This is specified in seconds, minutes, or milliseconds (i.e., 'min', 'sec', or 'ms'.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order. Syntax sort( INT window.length, STRING attribute, STRING order) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.length The size of the window length. INT No No attribute The attribute that should be checked for the order. The concatenation of all the attributes of the event is considered.

This allows developers to build applications that collect data, analyze it, and communicate the results in real time. This section illustrates the architecture of Siddhi and guides you through its key functionality. We hope this article helps developers to understand Siddhi and its codebase better, and also contribute to improve Siddhi by reporting and fixing bugs. Main Design Decisions Event by event processing of real-time streaming data to achieve low latency. Ease of use with Streaming SQL providing an intuitive way to express stream processing logic and complex event processing constructs such as Patterns. Achieve high performance by processing all events in-memory and by storing their states in-memory. Optimizing performance by enforcing a strict schema for event streams and by pre-compiling the queries. Optimizing memory consumption by having only the absolutely necessary information in-memory and dropping the rest as soon as possible. Supporting multiple extension points to accommodate a diverse set of functionality such as supporting multiple sources, sinks, functions, aggregation operations, windows, etc. High Level Architecture At a high level, Siddhi consumes events from various events sources, processes them according to the defined Siddhi application, and produces results to the subscribed event sinks. Siddhi can store and consume events from in-memory tables or from external data stores such as RDBMS , MongoDB , Hazelcast in-memory grid, etc. (i.e., when configured to do so). Siddhi also allows applications and users to query Siddhi via its Store Query API to interactively retrieve data from its in-memory and other stores. Main Modules in Siddhi Siddhi comprises four main modules, they are: Siddhi Query API : This allows you to define the execution logic of the Siddhi application as queries and definitions using POJO classes. Internally, Siddhi uses these objects to identify the tasks that it is expected to perform. Siddhi Query Compiler : This allows you to define the Siddhi application using the Siddhi Streaming SQL, and then it converts the Streaming SQL script to Siddhi Query POJO Objects so that Siddhi can execute them. Siddhi Core : This builds the execution runtime based on the defined Siddhi Application and processes the events as and when they arrive. Siddhi Annotation : This is a helper module that allows all extensions to be annotated, so that they can be picked by Siddhi Core for processing. This also helps Siddhi to generate the extension documentation. Siddhi Component Architecture The following diagram illustrates the main components of Siddhi and how they work together. Here the Siddhi Core module maintains the execution logic. It also interacts with the external environment and systems for consuming and publishing events. To achieve these tasks, it uses the following components: SiddhiManager : This is a key component of Siddhi Core that manages Siddhi Application Runtimes and facilitates their functionality via Siddhi Context with periodic state persistence, statistics reporting and extension loading. SiddhiAppRuntime : A Siddhi Application Runtime is generated for each Siddhi Application deployed. Siddhi Application Runtimes provide an isolated execution environment for each Siddhi Application defined. These Siddhi Application Runtimes are based on the logic of their Siddhi Application, and they consume and publish events from various external systems and Java or Python programmes. SiddhiContext : This is a shared object for all the Siddhi Application Runtimes within the Siddhi manager, and it contains references to the persistence store for periodic persistence, statistics manager to report performance statistics of Siddhi Application Runtimes, and extension holders for loading Siddhi extensions. Siddhi Application Creation Execution logic in Siddhi is composed as a Siddhi Application, and this is passed as a string to SiddhiManager to create the SiddhiAppRuntime for execution. When a Siddhi Application is passed to the SiddhiManager.createSiddhiAppRuntime() , it is processed internally with the SiddhiCompiler . Here, the SiddhiApp String is converted to SiddhiApp object model by the SiddhiQLBaseVisitorImpl class. The model is then passed to the SiddhiAppParser for the SiddhiAppRuntime creation. Siddhi App Execution Flow Following diagram depicts the execution flow within a Siddhi App Runtime. The path taken by events within Siddhi is indicated in blue. The components that are involved in handling the events are as follows: StreamJunction This routes events to various components within the Siddhi App Runtime. A stream junction is generated for each stream defined or inferred in the Siddhi Application. A stream junction by default uses the incoming event's thread for processing subscribed components, but it can also be configured via the @Async annotation to buffer the events and use a different thread for subsequent execution. InputHandler An instance of input handler is created for each stream junction, and this is used for pushing Event and Event[] objects into stream junctions from sources, and Java/Python programmes. StreamCallback This receives Event[] s from stream junction and passes them to sinks to publish to external endpoints, or passes them to subscribed Java/Python programmes for further processing. Queries Partitions These components process the events by filtering, transforming, joining, patten matching, etc. They consume events from one or more stream junctions, process them and publish the processed events into stream junctions based on the defined query or partition. Source Sources consume events from external sources in various data formats, convert them into Siddhi events and pass them to corresponding Stream Junctions via their Input Handlers. A source is generated for each @Source annotation defined above a stream definition. Each source consumes events from an external source in the data format configured for it. SourceMapper A source mapper needs to be configured for each source in order to convert the format of each incoming event to that of a Siddhi event. The source mapper type can be configured using the @Map annotation within the @Source annotation. When the @Map annotation is not defined, Siddhi uses the PassThroughSourceMapper , where it assumes that the incoming message is already in the Siddhi Event format, and therefore makes no changes to the event format. Sink Sinks convert the Siddhi Events to various data formats and publish them to external endpoints. A Sink generated for each @Sink annotation defined above a stream definition to publish the events arriving to that stream. SinkMapper A sink mapper is configured for each Sink in order to map the Siddhi events to the specified data format so that they can be published via the sink. The sink mapper type can be configured using the @Map annotation within the @Sink annotation. When the @Map annotation is not defined, Siddhi uses PassThroughSinkMapper , where it passes the Siddhi events in the existing format (i.e., the Siddhi event format) to the Sink. Table Tables store events. By default, Siddhi uses the InMemoryTable implementation to store events in-memory. When @Store annotation is used, it loads the associated Table implementation based on the defined store type. Most table implementations are extended from the AbstractRecordTable abstract class for ease of development. Window Windows store events and determine when events can be considered expired based on the given window constrain. Multiple types of windows are can be implemented by extending the WindowProcessor abstract class. IncrementalAggregation This allows you to obtain aggregates in an incremental manner for a specified set of time periods. Incremental aggregation functions can be implemented by extending IncrementalAttributeAggregator . Trigger A trigger triggers events at a given interval to the stream junction that has the same name as the trigger. QueryCallback A query callback receives notifications when events are emitted from queries. Then it notifies the event occurrence timestamp , and classifies the events into currentEvents , and expiredEvents . Siddhi Query Execution Siddhi QueryRuntimes can be categorized in to three main types: SingleInputStream : Queries that consist of query types such as filters and windows. JoinInputStream : Queries that consist of joins. StateInputStream : Queries that consist of patterns and sequences. Following section explains the internals of each query type. SingleInputStream Query Runtime (Filter Windows) A single input stream query runtime is generated for filter and window queries. They consume events from a stream junction or a window and convert the incoming events according to the expected output stream format at the ProcessStreamReceiver by dropping all the unrelated incoming stream attributes. Then the converted events are passed through a few Processors such as FilterProcessor , StreamProcessor , StreamFunctionProcessor , WindowProcessor and QuerySelector . Here, the StreamProcessor , StreamFunctionProcessor , and WindowProcessor can be extended with various stream processing capabilities. The last processor of the chain of processors must always be a QuerySelector , and each chain can have only one WindowProcessor . When the query runtime consumes events from a window, its chain of processors cannot contain a WindowProcessor . The FilterProcessor is implemented with an ExpressionExecutor that returns a boolean value. Expressions have a tree structure, and they are processed based on the Depth First Search algorithm. To achieve high performance, Siddhi currently depends on the user to formulate the least successful case in the leftmost side of the condition, thereby increasing the chance of an early false detection. The condition expression price = 100 and ( Symbol == 'IBM' or Symbol == 'MSFT' ) is represented as shown below. These expressions also support the execution of user defined functions (UDFs), and they can be implemented by extending the FunctionExecutor class. After getting processed by each processor, each event reaches the QuerySelector for transformation. At the QuerySelector , events are transformed based on the select clause of the query. If there is a Group By defined, then the GroupByKeyGenerator identifies the group by key, and then each AttributeProcessor is executed based on that group-by key. AttributeProcessors can contain any expression including constant values, variables and user defined functions. They can also contain AttributeAggregator s for processing aggregation operations such as sum , count , etc. Here, an AttributeAggregator is generated to keep track of the aggregation state. When it becomes obsolete, it is destroyed. The events are transformed to the expected output format through this operation. After an event is transformed to the output format, it is evaluated against the HavingConditionExecutor if a having clause is provided. Only the succeeding events are pushed to the OutputRateLimiter . At OutputRateLimiter , the event output is controlled before sending the events to the stream junction or to the query callback. When the output clause is not defined, the PassThroughOutputRateLimiter is used by passing all the events without any rate limiting. Temporal Processing with Windows The temporal event processing aspect is achieved via Window and AttributeAggregators To achieve temporal processing,Siddhi uses the following four type of events: Current Events : Events that are newly arriving to a query from streams. Expired Events : Events that have expired from a window. Timer Events : Events that inform the query about an update of execution time. These events are usually generated by schedulers. Reset Events : Events that resets the Siddhi query states. In Siddhi, when an event comes into a WindowProcessor , it creates an appropriate expired event corresponding to the incoming current event with the expiring timestamp, and stores that event in the window. The WindowProcessor also forwards the current event to the next processor for further processing. It uses a scheduler or such to determine when to emit the events it has in memory. During that time, it emits these events as expired events. If it needs to emit all the events in the memory at once, it emits a single reset event instead of sending one expired event for each event it has stored, so that it can reset the states in one go. For each current event emitted from a window, a corresponding expired event must be emitted. If not, a common reset event must be emitted. This is vital in Siddhi because Siddhi relies on these events to calculate the Aggregations at the QuerySelector . In the QuerySelector , the arrived current events increase the aggregation values, expired events decrease the values, and reset events reset the aggregation calculation. For example, the sliding TimeWindow creates a corresponding expired event for each current event that arrives, adds that to the window, adds an entry to the scheduler to notify when that event need to be expired by sending it a timer event, and finally sends the current event to the next processor for subsequent processing. When the window receives an indication that the expected expiry time has come for the oldest event in the window via a a timer event or other means, it removes the expired event from the window and passes that to the next processor. JoinInputStream Query Runtime (Join) Join input stream query runtime is generated for join queries. This can consume events from two stream junctions and perform a join operation as depicted above. It can also perform a join by consuming events from one stream junction and join against itself, or it can join against a table, window or an incremental aggregation. When a join is performed with a table, window or incremental aggregation, the WindowProcessor in the image is replaced with the table, window or incremental aggregation. No basic processors are used on their side. The joining operation is triggered by the events that arrive from the stream junction. Here, when an event from one stream reaches the pre JoinProcessor , it matches against all the available events of the other stream's WindowProcessor . When a match is found, those matched events are sent to the QuerySelector as current events, and at the same time, the original event is added to the WindowProcessor where it remains until it expires. Similarly, when an event expires from the WindowProcessor , it matches against all the available events of the other stream's WindowProcessor , and when a match is found, those matched events are sent to the QuerySelector as expired events. Note: Despite the optimizations, a join query is quite expensive when it comes to performance. This is because the WindowProcessor is locked during the matching process to avoid race conditions and to achieve accuracy while joining. Therefore, avoid matching large windows in high volume streams. Based on the scenario, using appropriate window sizes (by time or length) helps to achieve maximum performance. StateInputStream Query Runtime (Pattern Sequence) The state input stream query runtime is generated for pattern and sequence queries. This consumes events from one or more stream junctions via ProcessStreamReceivers . A ProcessStreamReceiver and a set of basic processors is defined in the query for each condition. When a ProcessStreamReceiver consumes the events, it updates the states with the incoming events that are generated by previous conditions. If the condition applied is the first condition in the query, then it creates a new state and updates that with the incoming event. This is then passed to basic processors to perform filtering and transformation operations. The states that pass the basic processors are consumed by the PostStateProcessor and stored at the PreStateProcessor of the following pattern or sequence condition. When the state reaches the final condition's PostStateProcessor , the output event is generated and emitted by QuerySelector . Siddhi Partition Execution A partition is a wrapper around one or more Siddhi queries and inner streams that connect them. A partition is implemented in Siddhi as a PartitionRuntime , and each unique partition instance is implemented as a PartitionInstanceRuntime Each partitioned stream entering the partition goes through the appropriate PartitionStreamReceiver . The PartitionExecutor of stream receiver evaluates the incoming events to identify the partition key using the RangePartitionExecutor or the ValuePartitionExecutor , and passes the events to the QueryRuntimes of the appropriate PartitionInstanceRuntime based on the partition key. If a PartitionInstanceRuntime is not available for the given partition key, it is dynamically generated via the relevant QueryRuntimes and InnerStreamJunctions . Based on the partition definition, the QueryRuntimes in the PartitionInstanceRuntime wire themselves via inner StreamJunctions or using StreamJunctions outside the partitions. When a partition query consumes a non partitioned global stream, all instances of its QueryRuntime that are part of multiple PartitionInstanceRuntimes receive the same event as depicted in the above diagram. Siddhi Event Formats Siddhi has three event formats. Event This is the format exposed to end users when they send events via Input Handler, and consume events via Stream Callback or Query Callback. This consists of an Object[] that contains all the values in accordance to the corresponding stream. StreamEvent (Subtype of ComplexEvent ) This is used within queries. This contains the following three Object[] s: - beforeWindowData : This contains values that are only used in processors that are executed before the WindowProcessor . - onAfterWindowData : This contains values that are only used by the WindowProcessor and the other processors that follow it, but not sent as output. - outputData : This contains the values that comply with the output stream of the query. In order to optimize the amount of data that is stored in the in-memory at windows, the content in beforeWindowData is cleared before the event enters the WindowProcessor . StreamEvents can also be chained by linking each other via the next property in them. StateEvent (Subtype of ComplexEvent ) This is used in Joins, Patterns and Sequences when we need to associate events of multiple streams, tables, windows and aggregations of different types together. This has a collection of StreamEvents representing different streams, tables, etc, that are used in the query, and outputData to contain the values that are needed for the query output. StreamEvents can also be chained by linking each other with the next property in them. Event Chunks Event Chunks provide an easier way of manipulating the chain of StreamEvents and StateEvents so that they are be easily iterated, inserted and removed.

It performs Stream Processing and Complex Event Processing on real time data streams. Siddhi is used by many companies including Uber and eBay (via Apache Eagle). Uber processes more than 20 billion events per day using Siddhi for fraud analytics, and Siddhi is used in Apache Eagle as a policy enforcement engine. This quick start guide contains the following six sections: Stream Processing and Complex Event Processing Overview - about the domain of Siddhi An Overview of Siddhi - Explaining the basic architecture Using Siddhi for the First Time - how to set up the software Siddhi \u2018Hello World!\u2019 - Your First Siddhi Application Simulating Events - Testing your query with simulated events A Bit of Stream Processing - temporal event processing 1. Stream Processing and Complex Event Processing (CEP) Overview Before diving into using Siddhi, let's first discuss Stream Processing and Complex Event Processing in brief so that we can identify the use-cases where Siddhi can be used. First let's understand what an event is through an example. If we consider the transactions carried out via an ATM as a data stream, one withdrawal from it can be considered an event . This event contains data about the amount, time, account number etc. Many such transactions form a stream. Forrester defines Streaming Analytics as: Software that provides analytical operators to orchestrate data flow , calculate analytics , and detect patterns on event data from multiple, disparate live data sources to allow developers to build applications that sense, think, and act in real time . Gartner\u2019s IT Glossary defines CEP as follows: \"CEP is a kind of computing in which incoming data about events is distilled into more useful, higher level \u201ccomplex\u201d event data that provides insight into what is happening.\" \" CEP is event-driven because the computation is triggered by the receipt of event data. CEP is used for highly demanding, continuous-intelligence applications that enhance situation awareness and support real-time decisions.\" Basically, Siddhi receives data event-by-event and processes them in real time to produce meaningful information. Siddhi Can be used in the following use-cases: Fraud Analytics Monitoring Anomaly Detection Sentiment Analysis Processing Customer Behaviour .. etc 2. Overview of Siddhi As indicated above, Siddhi can: accept event inputs from many different types of sources process them to generate insights publish them to many types of sinks. To use Siddhi, you need to write the processing logic as a Siddhi Application in the Siddhi Streaming SQL language which is discussed in the 4th section. After writing and starting a Siddhi application , it: Takes data one-by-one as events Processes the data in each event Generates new high level events based on the processing done so far Sends newly generated events as the output to streams. 3. Using Siddhi for the First Time In this section, we will be using the WSO2 Stream Processor(referred to as SP in the rest of this guide)\u200a\u2014\u200aa server version of Siddhi that has a sophisticated editor with a GUI (referred to as \u201cStream Processor Studio\u201d ) where you can write your query and simulate events as a data stream. Step 1 \u200a\u2014\u200aInstall Oracle Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 1.8. Step 2 \u200a\u2014\u200a Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable. Step 3 \u200a\u2014\u200aDownload the latest WSO2 Stream Processor . Step 4 \u200a\u2014\u200aExtract the downloaded zip and navigate to SP_HOME /bin . ( SP_HOME refers to the extracted folder) Step 5 \u200a\u2014\u200aIssue the following command in the command prompt (Windows) / terminal (Linux) For Windows: editor.bat For Linux: ./editor.sh For more details about WSO2 Stream Processor, see its Quick Start Guide . After successfully starting the Stream Processor Studio, the terminal in Linux should look like as shown below: After starting the WSO2 Stream Processor, access the Stream Processor Studio by visiting the following link in your browser. http://localhost:9390/editor This takes you to the Stream Processor Studio landing page. 4. Siddhi \u2018Hello World!\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200aYour First Siddhi Application Siddhi Streaming SQL is a rich, compact, easy-to-learn SQL-like language. Let's first learn how to find the total of values coming into a data stream and output the current running total value with each event. Siddhi has lot of in-built functions and extensions available for complex analysis, but to get started, let's use a simple one. You can find more information about the Siddhi grammar and its functions in the Siddhi Query Guide . Let's consider a scenario where we are loading cargo boxes into a ship . We need to keep track of the total weight of the cargo added. Measuring the weight of a cargo box when loading is considered an event . We can write a Siddhi program for the above scenario which has 4 parts . Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aGiving our Siddhi application a suitable name. This is a Siddhi routine. In this example, let's name our application as \u201cHelloWorldApp\u201d @App:name( HelloWorldApp ) Part 2\u200a\u2014\u200aDefining the input stream. The stream needs to have a name and a schema defining the data that each incoming event should contain. The event data attributes are expressed as name and type pairs. In this example: The name of the input stream\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cCargoStream\u201d This contains only one data attribute: The name of the data in each event\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cweight\u201d Type of the data \u201cweight\u201d \u200a\u2014\u200aint define stream CargoStream (weight int); Part 3 - Defining the output stream. This has the same info as the previous definition with an additional totalWeight attribute that contains the total weight calculated so far. Here, we need to add a \"sink\" to log the OutputStream so that we can observe the output values. ( Sink is the Siddhi way to publish streams to external systems. This particular log type sink just logs the stream events. To learn more about sinks, see sink ) @sink(type= log , prefix= LOGGER ) define stream OutputStream(weight int, totalWeight long); Part 4\u200a\u2014\u200aThe actual Siddhi query. Here we need to specify the following: A name for the query\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cHelloWorldQuery\u201d Which stream should be taken into processing\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cCargoStream\u201d What data we require in the output stream\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cweight\u201d , \u201ctotalWeight\u201d How the output should be calculated - by calculating the sum of the the weight s Which stream should be populated with the output\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cOutputStream\u201d @info(name= HelloWorldQuery ) from CargoStream select weight, sum(weight) as totalWeight insert into OutputStream; 5. Simulating Events The Stream Processor Studio has in-built support to simulate events. You can do it via the \u201cEvent Simulator\u201d panel at the left of the Stream Processor Studio. You should save your HelloWorldApp by browsing to File - Save before you run event simulation. Then click Event Simulator and configure it as shown below. Step 1\u200a\u2014\u200aConfigurations: Siddhi App Name\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cHelloWorldApp\u201d Stream Name\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cCargoStream\u201d Timestamp\u200a\u2014\u200a(Leave it blank) weight\u200a\u2014\u200a2 (or some integer) Step 2\u200a\u2014\u200aClick \u201cRun\u201d mode and then click \u201cStart\u201d . This starts the Siddhi Application. If the Siddhi application is successfully started, the following message is printed in the Stream Processor Studio console: \u201cHelloWorldApp.siddhi Started Successfully!\u201d Step 3\u200a\u2014\u200aClick \u201cSend\u201d and observe the terminal where you started WSO2 Stream Processor Studio. You can see a log that contains \u201coutputData=[2, 2]\u201d . Click Send again and observe a log with \u201coutputData=[2, 4]\u201d . You can change the value of the weight and send it to see how the sum of the weight is updated. Bravo! You have successfully completed creating Siddhi Hello World! 6. A Bit of Stream Processing - temporal event processing This section demonstrates how to carry out temporal window processing with Siddhi. Up to this point, we have been carrying out the processing by having only the running sum value in-memory. No events were stored during this process. Window processing is a method that allows us to store some events in-memory for a given period so that we can perform operations such as calculating the average, maximum, etc values within them. Let's imagine that when we are loading cargo boxes into the ship we need to keep track of the average weight of the recently loaded boxes so that we can balance the weight across the ship. For this purpose, let's try to find the average weight of last three boxes of each event. For window processing, we need to modify our query as follows: @info(name= HelloWorldQuery ) from CargoStream#window.length(3) select weight, sum(weight) as totalWeight, avg(weight) as averageWeight insert into OutputStream; from CargoStream#window.length(3) - Here, we are specifying that the last 3 events should be kept in memory for processing. avg(weight) as averageWeight - Here, we are calculating the average of events stored in the window and producing the average value as \"averageWeight\" (Note: Now the sum also calculates the totalWeight based on the last three events). We also need to modify the \"OutputStream\" definition to accommodate the new \"averageWeight\" . define stream OutputStream(weight int, totalWeight long, averageWeight double); The updated Siddhi Application should look as shown below: Now you can send events using the Event Simulator and observe the log to see the sum and average of the weights of the last three cargo events. It is also notable that the defined length window only keeps 3 events in-memory. When the 4th event arrives, the first event in the window is removed from memory. This ensures that the memory usage does not grow beyond a specific limit. There are also other implementations done in Siddhi to reduce the memory consumption.

A Bit of Stream Processing - temporal event processing"},{"location":"documentation/siddhi-4.x/query-guide-4.x/","text":"Siddhi 4.x Streaming SQL Guide Info Please find the latest Siddhi Streaming SQL Guide here Introduction Siddhi Streaming SQL is designed to process event streams in a streaming manner, detect complex event occurrences, and notify them in real-time. Siddhi Application Streaming processing and Complex Event Processing rules can be written is Siddhi Streaming SQL and they can be put together as a SiddhiApp in a single file. Purpose Each Siddhi Application is an isolated processing unit that allows you to deploy and execute queries independent of other Siddhi applications in the system. The following diagram depicts how event flows work with some of the key Siddhi Streaming SQL elements of the Siddhi Application. Below table provides brief description of a few key elements in the Siddhi Streaming SQL Language. Elements Description Stream A logical series of events ordered in time with a uniquely identifiable name, and set of defined attributes with specific data types defining its schema. Event An event is associated with only one stream, and all events of that stream have an identical set of attributes that are assigned specific types (or the same schema). An event contains a timestamp and set of attribute values according to the schema. Table A structured representation of data stored with a defined schema. Stored data can be backed by In-Memory , RDBMs , MongoDB , etc. to be accessed and manipulated at runtime. Query A logical construct that processes events in streaming manner by combining existing streams and/or tables, and generates events to an output stream or table. A query consumes one or more input streams, and zero or one table. Then it processes these events in a streaming manner and publishes the output events to streams or tables for further processing or to generate notifications. Source A contract that consumes data from external sources (such as TCP , Kafka , HTTP , etc)in the form of events, then converts each event (which can be in XML , JSON , binary , etc. format) to a Siddhi event, and passes that to a Stream for processing. Sink A contract that takes events arriving at a stream, maps them to a predefined data format (such as XML , JSON , binary , etc), and publishes them to external endpoints (such as E-mail , TCP , Kafka , HTTP , etc). Input Handler A mechanism to programmatically inject events into streams. Stream/Query Callback A mechanism to programmatically consume output events from streams and queries. Partition A logical container that isolates the processing of queries based on partition keys. Here, a separate instance of queries is generated for each partition key to achieve isolation. Inner Stream A positionable stream that connects portioned queries within their partitions, preserving isolation. Grammar An element of Siddhi SQL can be composed together as a script in a Siddhi application, Here each construct must be separated by a semicolon ( ; ) as shown in the below syntax. siddhi app : app annotation * ( stream definition | table definition | ... ) + ( query | partition ) + ; Example Siddhi Application named Temperature-Analytics defined with a stream named TempStream and a query named 5minAvgQuery for processing it. @ app : name ( Temperature-Analytics ) define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); @ name ( 5minAvgQuery ) from TempStream # window . time ( 5 min ) select roomNo , avg ( temp ) as avgTemp group by roomNo insert into OutputStream ; Stream A stream is a logical series of events ordered in time. Its schema is defined via the stream definition . A stream definition contains a unique name and a set of attributes with specific types and uniquely identifiable names within the stream. All the events that are selected to be received into a specific stream have the same schema (i.e., have the same attributes in the same order). Purpose By defining a schema it unifies common types of events together. This enables them to be processed via queries using their defined attributes in a streaming manner, and allow sinks and sources to map events to/from various data formats. Syntax The syntax for defining a new stream is as follows. define stream stream name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The following parameters are configured in a stream definition. Parameter Description stream name The name of the stream created. (It is recommended to define a stream name in PascalCase .) attribute name The schema of an stream is defined by its attributes with uniquely identifiable attribute names. (It is recommended to define attribute names in camelCase .) attribute type The type of each attribute defined in the schema. This can be STRING , INT , LONG , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL or OBJECT . To use and refer stream and attribute names that do not follow [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]* format enclose them in `. E.g. ``` $test(0)` ```. To make the stream process events in asynchronous and multi-threading manner use the @Async annotation as shown in Threading and Asynchronous configuration section. Example define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); The above creates a stream named TempStream with the following attributes. deviceID of type long roomNo of type int temp of type double Source Sources receive events via multiple transports and in various data formats, and direct them into streams for processing. A source configuration allows you to define a mapping in order to convert each incoming event from its native data format to a Siddhi event. When customizations to such mappings are not provided, Siddhi assumes that the arriving event adheres to the predefined format based on the stream definition and the selected message format. Purpose Source allows Siddhi to consume events from external systems, and map the events to adhere to the associated stream. Syntax To configure a stream that consumes events via a source, add the source configuration to a stream definition by adding the @source annotation with the required parameter values. The source syntax is as follows: @ source ( type = source_type , static . option . key1 = static_option_value1 , static . option . keyN = static_option_valueN , @ map ( type = map_type , static . option_key1 = static_option_value1 , static . option . keyN = static_option_valueN , @ attributes ( attributeN = attribute_mapping_N , attribute1 = attribute_mapping_1 ) ) ) define stream StreamName ( attribute1 Type1 , attributeN TypeN ); This syntax includes the following annotations. Source The type parameter of @source defines the source type that receives events. The other parameters to be configured depends on the source type selected, some of the the parameters are optional. For detailed information about the parameters see the documentation for the relevant source. The following is the list of source types that are currently supported: HTTP Kafka TCP In-memory WSO2Event Email JMS File RabbitMQ MQTT WebSocket Twitter Amazon SQS CDC Prometheus Source Mapper Each @source configuration has a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that converts the incoming messages format to Siddhi events. The type parameter of the @map defines the map type to be used to map the data. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional. For detailed information about the parameters see the documentation for the relevant mapper. Tip When the @map annotation is not provided, @map(type='passThrough') is used as default. This default mapper type can be used when source consumes Siddhi events and when it does not need any mappings. Map Attributes @attributes is an optional annotation used with @map to define custom mapping. When @attributes is not provided, each mapper assumes that the incoming events adhere to its own default data format. By adding the @attributes annotation, you can configure mappers to extract data from the incoming message selectively, and assign them to attributes. There are two ways you can configure map attributes. Defining attributes as keys and mapping content as values in the following format: @attributes( attributeN='mapping_N', attribute1='mapping_1') Defining the mapping content of all attributes in the same order as how the attributes are defined in stream definition: @attributes( 'mapping_1', 'mapping_N') Supported Mapping Types The following is a list of currently supported source mapping types: WSO2Event XML TEXT JSON Binary Key Value CSV Avro Example This query receives events via the HTTP source in the JSON data format, and directs them to the InputStream stream for processing. Here the HTTP source is configured to receive events on all network interfaces on the 8080 port, on the foo context, and it is secured via basic authentication. @ source ( type = http , receiver . url = http://0.0.0.0:8080/foo , basic . auth . enabled = true , @ map ( type = json )) define stream InputStream ( name string , age int , country string ); Sink Sinks publish events from the streams via multiple transports to external endpoints in various data formats. A sink configuration allows you to define a mapping to convert the Siddhi event to the required output data format (such as JSON , TEXT , XML , etc.). When customization to such mappings is not provided, Siddhi converts events to its default format based on the stream definition and the selected data format to publish the events. Purpose Sinks provide a way to publish Siddhi events to external systems in the preferred data format. Syntax To configure a stream to publish events via a sink, add the sink configuration to a stream definition by adding the @sink annotation with the required parameter values. The sink syntax is as follows: @ sink ( type = sink_type , static_option_key1 = static_option_value1 , dynamic_option_key1 = {{dynamic_option_value1}} , @ map ( type = map_type , static_option_key1 = static_option_value1 , dynamic_option_key1 = {{dynamic_option_value1}} , @ payload ( payload_mapping ) ) ) define stream StreamName ( attribute1 Type1 , attributeN TypeN ); Dynamic Properties The sink and sink mapper properties that are categorized as dynamic have the ability to absorb attributes values from their associated streams. This can be done by using the attribute names in double curly braces as {{...}} when configuring the property value. Some valid dynamic properties values are: '{{attribute1}}' 'This is {{attribute1}}' {{attribute1}} {{attributeN}} Here the attribute names in the double curly braces will be replaced with event values during execution. This syntax includes the following annotations. Sink The type parameter of the @sink annotation defines the sink type that publishes the events. The other parameters to be configured depends on the sink type selected. Some of these parameters are optional, and some can have dynamic values. For detailed information about the parameters see documentation for the relevant sink. The following is a list of currently supported sink types. HTTP Kafka TCP In-memory Log WSO2Event Email JMS File RabbitMQ MQTT WebSocket Amazon SQS Prometheus Distributed Sink Distributed Sinks publish events from a defined stream to multiple destination endpoints using load balancing and partitioning strategies. Any ordinary sink can be used as a distributed sink. A distributed sink configuration allows you to define a common mapping to convert the Siddhi events for all its destination endpoints, allows you to define a distribution strategy (e.g. roundRobin , partitioned ), and configuration for each specific endpoint destination. Purpose Distributed sinks provide a way to publish Siddhi events to multiple destination endpoints in the preferred data format. Syntax To configure a stream to publish events via a distributed sink, add the sink configuration to a stream definition by adding the @sink annotation and add the configuration parameters that are common of all the destination endpoints inside the @sink annotation along with @distribution and @destination annotations providing distribution strategy and endpoint specific configurations. The distributed sink syntax is as follows: RoundRobin Distributed Sink Publishes events to defined destinations in a round robin manner. @ sink ( type = sink_type , common_option_key1 = common_option_value1 , common_option_key2 = {{common_option_value1}} , @ map ( type = map_type , option_key1 = option_value1 , option_key2 = {{option_value1}} , @ payload ( payload_mapping ) ) @ distribution ( strategy = roundRobin , @ destination ( specific_option_key1 = specific_option_value1 ), @ destination ( specific_option_key1 = specific_option_value2 ))) ) define stream StreamName ( attribute1 Type1 , attributeN TypeN ); Partitioned Distributed Sink Publishes events to defined destinations by partitioning based on the hashcode of the events partition key. @ sink ( type = sink_type , common_option_key1 = common_option_value1 , common_option_key2 = {{common_option_value1}} , @ map ( type = map_type , option_key1 = option_value1 , option_key2 = {{option_value1}} , @ payload ( payload_mapping ) ) @ distribution ( strategy = partitioned , partitionKey = partition_key , @ destination ( specific_option_key1 = specific_option_value1 ), @ destination ( specific_option_key1 = specific_option_value2 ))) ) define stream StreamName ( attribute1 Type1 , attributeN TypeN ); Sink Mapper Each @sink annotation has a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that converts the Siddhi event to an outgoing message format. The type parameter of the @map annotation defines the map type based on which the event is mapped. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional and some have dynamic values. For detailed information about the parameters see the documentation for the relevant mapping type. Tip When the @map annotation is not provided, @map(type='passThrough') is used by default. This can be used when the sink publishes in the Siddhi event format, or when it does not need any mappings. Map Payload @payload is an optional annotation used with the @map annotation to define a custom mapping. When the @payload annotation is not provided, each mapper maps the outgoing events to its own default data format. By defining the @payload annotation you can configure mappers to produce the output payload with attribute names of your choice, using dynamic properties by selectively assigning the attributes in your preferred format. There are two ways you can configure the @payload annotation. Some mappers such as XML , JSON , and Test accept only one output payload using the following format: @payload( 'This is a test message from {{user}}.' ) Some mappers such key-value accept series of mapping values defined as follows: @payload( key1='mapping_1', 'key2'='user : {{user}}') Here, apart from the dotted key names sush as a.b.c , any constant string value such as '$abc' can also by used as a key. Supported Mapping Types The following is a list of currently supported sink mapping types: WSO2Event XML TEXT JSON Binary Key Value CSV Avro Example Following query publishes events from the OutputStream stream to an HTTP endpoint. Here the events are mapped to the default JSON payloads and sent to http://localhost:8005/endpoint using the POST method, with the Accept header, and secured via basic authentication where admin is both the username and the password. @ sink ( type = http , publisher . url = http://localhost:8005/endpoint , method = POST , headers = Accept-Date:20/02/2017 , basic . auth . username = admin , basic . auth . password = admin , basic . auth . enabled = true , @ map ( type = json )) define stream OutputStream ( name string , ang int , country string ); Following query publishes events from the OutputStream stream to multiple the HTTP endpoints using partitioning strategy. Here the events sent to either http://localhost:8005/endpoint1 or http://localhost:8006/endpoint2 based on the partitioning key country . It uses default JSON mapping, POST method, and used admin as both the username and the password when publishing to both the endpoints. @ sink ( type = http , method = POST , basic . auth . username = admin , basic . auth . password = admin , basic . auth . enabled = true , @ map ( type = json ), @ distribution ( strategy = partitioned , partitionKey = country , @ destination ( publisher . url = http://localhost:8005/endpoint1 ), @ destination ( publisher . url = http://localhost:8006/endpoint2 ))) define stream OutputStream ( name string , ang int , country string ); Query Each Siddhi query can consume one or more streams, and 0-1 tables, process the events in a streaming manner, and then generate an output event to a stream or perform a CRUD operation to a table. Purpose A query enables you to perform complex event processing and stream processing operations by processing incoming events one by one in the order they arrive. Syntax All queries contain an input and an output section. Some also contain a projection section. A simple query with all three sections is as follows. from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream / table Example This query included in a Siddhi Application consumes events from the TempStream stream (that is already defined) and outputs the room temperature and the room number to the RoomTempStream stream. define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); from TempStream select roomNo , temp insert into RoomTempStream ; Inferred Stream Here, the RoomTempStream is an inferred Stream, which means it can be used as any other defined stream without explicitly defining its stream definition. The definition of the RoomTempStream is inferred from the first query that produces the stream. Query Projection Siddhi queries supports the following for query projections. Action Description Selecting required objects for projection This involves selecting only some of the attributes from the input stream to be inserted into an output stream. E.g., The following query selects only the `roomNo` and `temp` attributes from the `TempStream` stream. from TempStream select roomNo, temp insert into RoomTempStream; Selecting all attributes for projection Selecting all the attributes in an input stream to be inserted into an output stream. This can be done by using asterisk ( * ) or by omitting the `select` statement. E.g., Both the following queries select all the attributes in the `NewTempStream` stream. from TempStream select * insert into NewTempStream; or from TempStream insert into NewTempStream; Renaming attributes This selects attributes from the input streams and inserts them into the output stream with different names. E.g., This query renames `roomNo` to `roomNumber` and `temp` to `temperature`. from TempStream select roomNo as roomNumber, temp as temperature insert into RoomTempStream; Introducing the constant value This adds constant values by assigning it to an attribute using `as`. E.g., This query specifies 'C' to be used as the constant value for `scale` attribute. from TempStream select roomNo, temp, 'C' as scale insert into RoomTempStream; Using mathematical and logical expressions This uses attributes with mathematical and logical expressions in the precedence order given below, and assigns them to the output attribute using `as`. Operator precedence Operator Distribution Example () Scope (cost + tax) * 0.05 IS NULL Null check deviceID is null NOT Logical NOT not (price > 10) * / % Multiplication, division, modulo temp * 9/5 + 32 + - Addition, substraction temp * 9/5 - 32 < < = > >= Comparators: less-than, greater-than-equal, greater-than, less-than-equal totalCost >= price * quantity == != Comparisons: equal, not equal totalCost != price * quantity IN Contains in table roomNo in ServerRoomsTable AND Logical AND temp < 40 and (humidity < 40 or humidity >= 60) OR Logical OR temp < 40 or (humidity < 40 and humidity >= 60) E.g., Converting Celsius to Fahrenheit and identifying rooms with room number between 10 and 15 as server rooms. from TempStream select roomNo, temp * 9/5 + 32 as temp, 'F' as scale, roomNo > 10 and roomNo < 15 as isServerRoom insert into RoomTempStream; Function A function consumes zero, one or more parameters and always produces a result value. It can be used in any location where an attribute can be used. Purpose Functions encapsulates complex execution logic that makes Siddhi applications simple and easy to understand. Function Parameters Functions parameters can be attributes, constant values, results of other functions, results of mathematical or logical expressions or time parameters. Function parameters vary depending on the function being called. Time is a special parameter that can be defined using the integer time value followed by its unit as int unit . Following are the supported unit types. Upon execution, time returns the value in the scale of milliseconds as a long value. Unit Syntax Year year | years Month month | months Week week | weeks Day day | days Hour hour | hours Minutes minute | minutes | min Seconds second | seconds | sec Milliseconds millisecond | milliseconds E.g. Passing 1 hour and 25 minutes to test() function. test(1 hour 25 min) Note Functions, mathematical expressions, and logical expressions can be used in a nested manner. Following are some inbuilt functions shipped with Siddhi, for more functions refer execution extensions . eventTimestamp log UUID default cast convert ifThenElse minimum maximum coalesce instanceOfBoolean instanceOfDouble instanceOfFloat instanceOfInteger instanceOfLong instanceOfString Example The following configuration converts the roomNo to string and adds a messageID to each event using the convert and UUID functions. from TempStream select convert ( roomNo , string ) as roomNo , temp , UUID () as messageID insert into RoomTempStream ; Filter Filters are included in queries to filter information from input streams based on a specified condition. Purpose A filter allows you to separate events that match a specific condition as the output, or for further processing. Syntax Filter conditions should be defined in square brackets next to the input stream name as shown below. from input stream [ filter condition ] select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream Example This query filters all server rooms of which the room number is within the range of 100-210, and having temperature greater than 40 degrees from the TempStream stream, and inserts the results into the HighTempStream stream. from TempStream [( roomNo = 100 and roomNo 210 ) and temp 40 ] select roomNo , temp insert into HighTempStream ; Window Windows allow you to capture a subset of events based on a specific criterion from an input stream for calculation. Each input stream can only have a maximum of one window. Purpose To create subsets of events within a stream based on time duration, number of events, etc for processing. A window can operate in a sliding or tumbling (batch) manner. Syntax The #window prefix should be inserted next to the relevant stream in order to use a window. from input stream # window . window name ( parameter , parameter , ... ) select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert event type into output stream Note Filter condition can be applied both before and/or after the window Example If you want to identify the maximum temperature out of the last 10 events, you need to define a length window of 10 events. This window operates in a sliding mode where the following 3 subsets are calculated when a list of 12 events are received in a sequential order. Subset Event Range 1 1-10 2 2-11 3 3-12 The following query finds the maximum temperature out of last 10 events from the TempStream stream, and inserts the results into the MaxTempStream stream. from TempStream # window . length ( 10 ) select max ( temp ) as maxTemp insert into MaxTempStream ; If you define the maximum temperature reading out of every 10 events, you need to define a lengthBatch window of 10 events. This window operates as a batch/tumbling mode where the following 3 subsets are calculated when a list of 30 events are received in a sequential order. Subset Event Range 1 1-10 2 11-20 3 21-30 The following query finds the maximum temperature out of every 10 events from the TempStream stream, and inserts the results into the MaxTempStream stream. from TempStream # window . lengthBatch ( 10 ) select max ( temp ) as maxTemp insert into MaxTempStream ; Note Similar operations can be done based on time via time windows and timeBatch windows and for others. Code segments such as #window.time(10 min) considers events that arrive during the last 10 minutes in a sliding manner, and the #window.timeBatch(2 min) considers events that arrive every 2 minutes in a tumbling manner. Following are some inbuilt windows shipped with Siddhi. For more window types, see execution extensions . time timeBatch batch timeLength length lengthBatch sort frequent lossyFrequent session cron externalTime externalTimeBatch delay Output event types Projection of the query depends on the output event types such as, current and expired event types. By default all queries produce current events and only queries with windows produce expired events when events expire from the window. You can specify whether the output of a query should be only current events, only expired events or both current and expired events. Note! Controlling the output event types does not alter the execution within the query, and it does not affect the accuracy of the query execution. The following keywords can be used with the output stream to manipulate output. Output event types Description current events Outputs events when incoming events arrive to be processed by the query. This is default when no specific output event type is specified. expired events Outputs events when events expires from the window. all events Outputs events when incoming events arrive to be processed by the query as well as when events expire from the window. The output event type keyword can be used between insert and into as shown in the following example. Example This query delays all events in a stream by 1 minute. from TempStream # window . time ( 1 min ) select * insert expired events into DelayedTempStream Aggregate function Aggregate functions perform aggregate calculations in the query. When a window is defined the aggregation is restricted within that window. If no window is provided aggregation is performed from the start of the Siddhi application. Syntax from input stream # window . window name ( parameter , parameter , ... ) select aggregate function ( parameter , parameter , ... ) as attribute name , attribute2 name , ... insert into output stream ; Aggregate Parameters Aggregate parameters can be attributes, constant values, results of other functions or aggregates, results of mathematical or logical expressions, or time parameters. Aggregate parameters configured in a query depends on the aggregate function being called. Example The following query calculates the average value for the temp attribute of the TempStream stream. This calculation is done for the last 10 minutes in a sliding manner, and the result is output as avgTemp to the AvgTempStream output stream. from TempStream # window . time ( 10 min ) select avg ( temp ) as avgTemp , roomNo , deviceID insert into AvgTempStream ; Following are some inbuilt aggregation functions shipped with Siddhi, for more aggregation functions, see execution extensions . avg sum max min count distinctCount maxForever minForever stdDev Group By Group By allows you to group the aggregate based on specified attributes. Syntax The syntax for the Group By aggregate function is as follows: from input stream # window . window name (...) select aggregate function ( parameter , parameter , ...) as attribute1 name , attribute2 name , ... group by attribute1 name , attribute2 name ... insert into output stream ; Example The following query calculates the average temperature per roomNo and deviceID combination, for events that arrive at the TempStream stream for a sliding time window of 10 minutes. from TempStream # window . time ( 10 min ) select avg ( temp ) as avgTemp , roomNo , deviceID group by roomNo , deviceID insert into AvgTempStream ; Having Having allows you to filter events after processing the select statement. Purpose This allows you to filter the aggregation output. Syntax The syntax for the Having clause is as follows: from input stream # window . window name ( ... ) select aggregate function ( parameter , parameter , ...) as attribute1 name , attribute2 name , ... group by attribute1 name , attribute2 name ... having condition insert into output stream ; Example The following query calculates the average temperature per room for the last 10 minutes, and alerts if it exceeds 30 degrees. from TempStream # window . time ( 10 min ) select avg ( temp ) as avgTemp , roomNo group by roomNo having avgTemp 30 insert into AlertStream ; Order By Order By allows you to order the aggregated result in ascending and/or descending order based on specified attributes. By default ordering will be done in ascending manner. User can use 'desc' keyword to order in descending manner. Syntax The syntax for the Order By clause is as follows: from input stream # window . window name ( ... ) select aggregate function ( parameter , parameter , ...) as attribute1 name , attribute2 name , ... group by attribute1 name , attribute2 name ... having condition order by attribute1 name ( asc | desc ) ? , attribute2 name ( ascend / descend ) ? , ... insert into output stream ; Example The following query calculates the average temperature per roomNo and deviceID combination for every 10 minutes, and generate output events by ordering them in the ascending order of the room's avgTemp and then by the descending order of roomNo. from TempStream # window . timeBatch ( 10 min ) select avg ( temp ) as avgTemp , roomNo , deviceID group by roomNo , deviceID order by avgTemp , roomNo desc insert into AvgTempStream ; Limit Offset When events are emitted as a batch, offset allows you to offset beginning of the output event batch and limit allows you to limit the number of events in the batch from the defined offset. With this users can specify which set of events need be emitted. Syntax The syntax for the Limit Offset clause is as follows: from input stream # window . window name ( ... ) select aggregate function ( parameter , parameter , ...) as attribute1 name , attribute2 name , ... group by attribute1 name , attribute2 name ... having condition order by attribute1 name ( asc | desc ) ? , attribute2 name ( ascend / descend ) ? , ... limit positive interger ? offset positive interger ? insert into output stream ; Here both limit and offset are optional where limit by default output all the events and offset by default set to 0 . Example The following query calculates the average temperature per roomNo and deviceID combination, for events that arrive at the TempStream stream for every 10 minutes and emits two events with highest average temperature. from TempStream # window . timeBatch ( 10 min ) select avg ( temp ) as avgTemp , roomNo , deviceID group by roomNo , deviceID order by avgTemp desc limit 2 insert into HighestAvgTempStream ; The following query calculates the average temperature per roomNo and deviceID combination, for events that arrive at the TempStream stream for every 10 minutes and emits third, forth and fifth events when sorted in descending order based on their average temperature. from TempStream # window . timeBatch ( 10 min ) select avg ( temp ) as avgTemp , roomNo , deviceID group by roomNo , deviceID order by avgTemp desc limit 3 offset 2 insert into HighestAvgTempStream ; Join (Stream) Joins allow you to get a combined result from two streams in real-time based on a specified condition. Purpose Streams are stateless. Therefore, in order to join two streams, they need to be connected to a window so that there is a pool of events that can be used for joining. Joins also accept conditions to join the appropriate events from each stream. During the joining process each incoming event of each stream is matched against all the events in the other stream's window based on the given condition, and the output events are generated for all the matching event pairs. Note Join can also be performed with stored data , aggregation or externally defined windows . Syntax The syntax for a join is as follows: from input stream # window . window name ( parameter , ... ) { unidirectional } { as reference } join input stream # window . window name ( parameter , ... ) { unidirectional } { as reference } on join condition select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream Here, the join condition allows you to match the attributes from both the streams. Unidirectional join operation By default, events arriving at either stream can trigger the joining process. However, if you want to control the join execution, you can add the unidirectional keyword next to a stream in the join definition as depicted in the syntax in order to enable that stream to trigger the join operation. Here, events arriving at other stream only update the window of that stream, and this stream does not trigger the join operation. Note The unidirectional keyword cannot be applied to both the input streams because the default behaviour already allows both streams to trigger the join operation. Example Assuming that the temperature of regulators are updated every minute. Following is a Siddhi App that controls the temperature regulators if they are not already on for all the rooms with a room temperature greater than 30 degrees. define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); define stream RegulatorStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , isOn bool ); from TempStream [ temp 30 . 0 ] # window . time ( 1 min ) as T join RegulatorStream [ isOn == false ] # window . length ( 1 ) as R on T . roomNo == R . roomNo select T . roomNo , R . deviceID , start as action insert into RegulatorActionStream ; Supported join types Following are the supported operations of a join clause. Inner join (join) This is the default behaviour of a join operation. join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. The output is generated only if there is a matching event in both the streams. Left outer join The left outer join operation allows you to join two streams to be merged based on a condition. left outer join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. Here, it returns all the events of left stream even if there are no matching events in the right stream by having null values for the attributes of the right stream. Example The following query generates output events for all events from the StockStream stream regardless of whether a matching symbol exists in the TwitterStream stream or not. from StockStream#window.time(1 min) as S left outer join TwitterStream#window.length(1) as T on S.symbol== T.symbol select S.symbol as symbol, T.tweet, S.price insert into outputStream ; Right outer join This is similar to a left outer join. Right outer join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. It returns all the events of the right stream even if there are no matching events in the left stream. Full outer join The full outer join combines the results of left outer join and right outer join. full outer join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. Here, output event are generated for each incoming event even if there are no matching events in the other stream. Example The following query generates output events for all the incoming events of each stream regardless of whether there is a match for the symbol attribute in the other stream or not. from StockStream#window.time(1 min) as S full outer join TwitterStream#window.length(1) as T on S.symbol== T.symbol select S.symbol as symbol, T.tweet, S.price insert into outputStream ; Pattern This is a state machine implementation that allows you to detect patterns in the events that arrive over time. This can correlate events within a single stream or between multiple streams. Purpose Patterns allow you to identify trends in events over a time period. Syntax The following is the syntax for a pattern query: from ( every ) ? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ] - ( every ) ? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ] - ... ( within time gap ) ? select event reference . attribute name , event reference . attribute name , ... insert into output stream Items Description - This is used to indicate an event that should be following another event. The subsequent event does not necessarily have to occur immediately after the preceding event. The condition to be met by the preceding event should be added before the sign, and the condition to be met by the subsequent event should be added after the sign. event reference This allows you to add a reference to the the matching event so that it can be accessed later for further processing. (within time gap )? The within clause is optional. It defines the time duration within which all the matching events should occur. every every is an optional keyword. This defines whether the event matching should be triggered for every event arrival in the specified stream with the matching condition. When this keyword is not used, the matching is carried out only once. Siddhi also supports pattern matching with counting events and matching events in a logical order such as ( and , or , and not ). These are described in detail further below in this guide. Example This query sends an alert if the temperature of a room increases by 5 degrees within 10 min. from every ( e1 = TempStream ) - e2 = TempStream [ e1 . roomNo == roomNo and ( e1 . temp + 5 ) = temp ] within 10 min select e1 . roomNo , e1 . temp as initialTemp , e2 . temp as finalTemp insert into AlertStream ; Here, the matching process begins for each event in the TempStream stream (because every is used with e1=TempStream ), and if another event arrives within 10 minutes with a value for the temp attribute that is greater than or equal to e1.temp + 5 of the event e1, an output is generated via the AlertStream . Counting Pattern Counting patterns allow you to match multiple events that may have been received for the same matching condition. The number of events matched per condition can be limited via condition postfixes. Syntax Each matching condition can contain a collection of events with the minimum and maximum number of events to be matched as shown in the syntax below. from ( every ) ? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ] ( min count : max count ) ? - ... ( within time gap ) ? select event reference ([ event index ]) ? . attribute name , ... insert into output stream Postfix Description Example n1:n2 This matches n1 to n2 events (including n1 and not more than n2 ). 1:4 matches 1 to 4 events. n: This matches n or more events (including n ). 2: matches 2 or more events. :n This matches up to n events (excluding n ). :5 matches up to 5 events. n This matches exactly n events. 5 matches exactly 5 events. Specific occurrences of the event in a collection can be retrieved by using an event index with its reference. Square brackets can be used to indicate the event index where 1 can be used as the index of the first event and last can be used as the index for the last available event in the event collection. If you provide an index greater then the last event index, the system returns null . The following are some valid examples. e1[3] refers to the 3rd event. e1[last] refers to the last event. e1[last - 1] refers to the event before the last event. Example The following Siddhi App calculates the temperature difference between two regulator events. define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); define stream RegulatorStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , tempSet double , isOn bool ); from every ( e1 = RegulatorStream ) - e2 = TempStream [ e1 . roomNo == roomNo ] 1 : - e3 = RegulatorStream [ e1 . roomNo == roomNo ] select e1 . roomNo , e2 [ 0 ]. temp - e2 [ last ]. temp as tempDiff insert into TempDiffStream ; Logical Patterns Logical patterns match events that arrive in temporal order and correlate them with logical relationships such as and , or and not . Syntax from ( every ) ? ( not ) ? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ] (( and | or ) event reference = input stream [ filter condition ]) ? ( within time gap ) ? - ... select event reference ([ event index ]) ? . attribute name , ... insert into output stream Keywords such as and , or , or not can be used to illustrate the logical relationship. Key Word Description and This allows both conditions of and to be matched by two events in any order. or The state succeeds if either condition of or is satisfied. Here the event reference of the other condition is null . not condition1 and condition2 When not is included with and , it identifies the events that match arriving before any event that match . not condition for time period When not is included with for , it allows you to identify a situation where no event that matches condition1 arrives during the specified time period . e.g., from not TemperatureStream[temp 60] for 5 sec . Here the not pattern can be followed by either an and clause or the effective period of not can be concluded after a given time period . Further in Siddhi more than two streams cannot be matched with logical conditions using and , or , or not clauses at this point. Detecting Non-occurring Events Siddhi allows you to detect non-occurring events via multiple combinations of the key words specified above as shown in the table below. In the patterns listed, P* can be either a regular event pattern, an absent event pattern or a logical pattern. Pattern Detected Scenario not A for time period The non-occurrence of event A within time period after system start up. e.g., Generating an alert if a taxi has not reached its destination within 30 minutes, to indicate that the passenger might be in danger. not A for time period and B After system start up, event A does not occur within time period , but event B occurs at some point in time. e.g., Generating an alert if a taxi has not reached its destination within 30 minutes, and the passenger marked that he/she is in danger at some point in time. not A for time period 1 and not B for time period 2 After system start up, event A doess not occur within time period 1 , and event B also does not occur within time period 2 . e.g., Generating an alert if the driver of a taxi has not reached the destination within 30 minutes, and the passenger has not marked himself/herself to be in danger within that same time period. not A for time period or B After system start up, either event A does not occur within time period , or event B occurs at some point in time. e.g., Generating an alert if the taxi has not reached its destination within 30 minutes, or if the passenger has marked that he/she is in danger at some point in time. not A for time period 1 or not B for time period 2 After system start up, either event A does not occur within time period 1 , or event B occurs within time period 2 . e.g., Generating an alert to indicate that the driver is not on an expected route if the taxi has not reached destination A within 20 minutes, or reached destination B within 30 minutes. A \u2192 not B for time period Event B does not occur within time period after the occurrence of event A. e.g., Generating an alert if the taxi has reached its destination, but this was not followed by a payment record. P* \u2192 not A for time period and B After the occurrence of P*, event A does not occur within time period , and event B occurs at some point in time. P* \u2192 not A for time period 1 and not B for time period 2 After the occurrence of P*, event A does not occur within time period 1 , and event B does not occur within time period 2 . P* \u2192 not A for time period or B After the occurrence of P*, either event A does not occur within time period , or event B occurs at some point in time. P* \u2192 not A for time period 1 or not B for time period 2 After the occurrence of P*, either event A does not occur within time period 1 , or event B does not occur within time period 2 . not A for time period \u2192 B Event A does occur within time period after the system start up, but event B occurs after that time period has elapsed. not A for time period and B \u2192 P* Event A does not occur within time period , and event B occurs at some point in time. Then P* occurs after the time period has elapsed, and after B has occurred. not A for time period 1 and not B for time period 2 \u2192 P* After system start up, event A does not occur within time period 1 , and event B does not occur within time period 2 . However, P* occurs after both A and B. not A for time period or B \u2192 P* After system start up, event A does not occur within time period or event B occurs at some point in time. The P* occurs after time period has elapsed, or after B has occurred. not A for time period 1 or not B for time period 2 \u2192 P* After system start up, either event A does not occur within time period 1 , or event B does not occur within time period 2 . Then P* occurs after both time period 1 and time period 2 have elapsed. not A and B Event A does not occur before event B. A and not B Event B does not occur before event A. Example Following Siddhi App, sends the stop control action to the regulator when the key is removed from the hotel room. define stream RegulatorStateChangeStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , tempSet double , action string ); define stream RoomKeyStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , action string ); from every ( e1 = RegulatorStateChangeStream [ action == on ] ) - e2 = RoomKeyStream [ e1 . roomNo == roomNo and action == removed ] or e3 = RegulatorStateChangeStream [ e1 . roomNo == roomNo and action == off ] select e1 . roomNo , ifThenElse ( e2 is null , none , stop ) as action having action != none insert into RegulatorActionStream ; This Siddhi Application generates an alert if we have switch off the regulator before the temperature reaches 12 degrees. define stream RegulatorStateChangeStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , tempSet double , action string ); define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); from e1 = RegulatorStateChangeStream [ action == start ] - not TempStream [ e1 . roomNo == roomNo and temp 12 ] and e2 = RegulatorStateChangeStream [ action == off ] select e1 . roomNo as roomNo insert into AlertStream ; This Siddhi Application generates an alert if the temperature does not reduce to 12 degrees within 5 minutes of switching on the regulator. define stream RegulatorStateChangeStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , tempSet double , action string ); define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); from e1 = RegulatorStateChangeStream [ action == start ] - not TempStream [ e1 . roomNo == roomNo and temp 12 ] for 5 min select e1 . roomNo as roomNo insert into AlertStream ; Sequence Sequence is a state machine implementation that allows you to detect the sequence of event occurrences over time. Here all matching events need to arrive consecutively to match the sequence condition, and there cannot be any non-matching events arriving within a matching sequence of events. This can correlate events within a single stream or between multiple streams. Purpose This allows you to detect a specified event sequence over a specified time period. Syntax The syntax for a sequence query is as follows: from ( every ) ? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ], event reference = input stream [ filter condition ], ... ( within time gap ) ? select event reference . attribute name , event reference . attribute name , ... insert into output stream Items Description , This represents the immediate next event i.e., when an event that matches the first condition arrives, the event that arrives immediately after it should match the second condition. event reference This allows you to add a reference to the the matching event so that it can be accessed later for further processing. (within time gap )? The within clause is optional. It defines the time duration within which all the matching events should occur. every every is an optional keyword. This defines whether the matching event should be triggered for every event that arrives at the specified stream with the matching condition. When this keyword is not used, the matching is carried out only once. Example This query generates an alert if the increase in the temperature between two consecutive temperature events exceeds one degree. from every e1 = TempStream , e2 = TempStream [ e1 . temp + 1 temp ] select e1 . temp as initialTemp , e2 . temp as finalTemp insert into AlertStream ; Counting Sequence Counting sequences allow you to match multiple events for the same matching condition. The number of events matched per condition can be limited via condition postfixes such as Counting Patterns , or by using the * , + , and ? operators. The matching events can also be retrieved using event indexes, similar to how it is done in Counting Patterns . Syntax Each matching condition in a sequence can contain a collection of events as shown below. from ( every ) ? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ]( +|*|? ) ? , event reference = input stream [ filter condition ]( +|*|? ) ? , ... ( within time gap ) ? select event reference . attribute name , event reference . attribute name , ... insert into output stream Postfix symbol Required/Optional Description + Optional This matches one or more events to the given condition. * Optional This matches zero or more events to the given condition. ? Optional This matches zero or one events to the given condition. Example This Siddhi application identifies temperature peeks. define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); from every e1 = TempStream , e2 = TempStream [ e1 . temp = temp ] + , e3 = TempStream [ e2 [ last ]. temp temp ] select e1 . temp as initialTemp , e2 [ last ]. temp as peakTemp insert into PeekTempStream ; Logical Sequence Logical sequences identify logical relationships using and , or and not on consecutively arriving events. Syntax The syntax for a logical sequence is as follows: from ( every ) ? ( not ) ? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ] (( and | or ) event reference = input stream [ filter condition ]) ? ( within time gap ) ? , ... select event reference ([ event index ]) ? . attribute name , ... insert into output stream Keywords such as and , or , or not can be used to illustrate the logical relationship, similar to how it is done in Logical Patterns . Example This Siddhi application notifies the state when a regulator event is immediately followed by both temperature and humidity events. define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , temp double ); define stream HumidStream ( deviceID long , humid double ); define stream RegulatorStream ( deviceID long , isOn bool ); from every e1 = RegulatorStream , e2 = TempStream and e3 = HumidStream select e2 . temp , e3 . humid insert into StateNotificationStream ; Output rate limiting Output rate limiting allows queries to output events periodically based on a specified condition. Purpose This allows you to limit the output to avoid overloading the subsequent executions, and to remove unnecessary information. Syntax The syntax of an output rate limiting configuration is as follows: from input stream ... select attribute name , attribute name , ... output rate limiting configuration insert into output stream Siddhi supports three types of output rate limiting configurations as explained in the following table: Rate limiting configuration Syntax Description Based on time output event every time interval This outputs output event every time interval time interval. Based on number of events output event every event interval events This outputs output event for every event interval number of events. Snapshot based output snapshot every time interval This outputs all events in the window (or the last event if no window is defined in the query) for every given time interval time interval. Here the output event specifies the event(s) that should be returned as the output of the query. The possible values are as follows: * first : Only the first event processed by the query during the specified time interval/sliding window is emitted. * last : Only the last event processed by the query during the specified time interval/sliding window is emitted. * all : All the events processed by the query during the specified time interval/sliding window are emitted. When no output event is defined, all is used by default. Examples Returning events based on the number of events Here, events are emitted every time the specified number of events arrive. You can also specify whether to emit only the first event/last event, or all the events out of the events that arrived. In this example, the last temperature per sensor is emitted for every 10 events. from TempStreamselect select temp, deviceID group by deviceID output last every 10 events insert into LowRateTempStream; Returning events based on time Here events are emitted for every predefined time interval. You can also specify whether to emit only the first event, last event, or all events out of the events that arrived during the specified time interval. In this example, emits all temperature events every 10 seconds from TempStreamoutput output every 10 sec insert into LowRateTempStream; Returning a periodic snapshot of events This method works best with windows. When an input stream is connected to a window, snapshot rate limiting emits all the current events that have arrived and do not have corresponding expired events for every predefined time interval. If the input stream is not connected to a window, only the last current event for each predefined time interval is emitted. This query emits a snapshot of the events in a time window of 5 seconds every 1 second. from TempStream#window.time(5 sec) output snapshot every 1 sec insert into SnapshotTempStream; Partition Partitions divide streams and queries into isolated groups in order to process them in parallel and in isolation. A partition can contain one or more queries and there can be multiple instances where the same queries and streams are replicated for each partition. Each partition is tagged with a partition key. Those partitions only process the events that match the corresponding partition key. Purpose Partitions allow you to process the events groups in isolation so that event processing can be performed using the same set of queries for each group. Partition key generation A partition key can be generated in the following two methods: Partition by value This is created by generating unique values using input stream attributes. Syntax partition with ( expression of stream name , expression of stream name , ... ) begin query query ... end; Example This query calculates the maximum temperature recorded within the last 10 events per deviceID . partition with ( deviceID of TempStream ) begin from TempStream#window.length(10) select roomNo, deviceID, max(temp) as maxTemp insert into DeviceTempStream; end; Partition by range This is created by mapping each partition key to a range condition of the input streams numerical attribute. Syntax partition with ( condition as partition key or condition as partition key or ... of stream name , ... ) begin query query ... end; Example This query calculates the average temperature for the last 10 minutes per office area. partition with ( roomNo = 1030 as 'serverRoom' or roomNo 1030 and roomNo = 330 as 'officeRoom' or roomNo 330 as 'lobby' of TempStream) begin from TempStream#window.time(10 min) select roomNo, deviceID, avg(temp) as avgTemp insert into AreaTempStream end; Inner Stream Queries inside a partition block can use inner streams to communicate with each other while preserving partition isolation. Inner streams are denoted by a \"#\" placed before the stream name, and these streams cannot be accessed outside a partition block. Purpose Inner streams allow you to connect queries within the partition block so that the output of a query can be used as an input only by another query within the same partition. Therefore, you do not need to repartition the streams if they are communicating within the partition. Example This partition calculates the average temperature of every 10 events for each sensor, and sends an output to the DeviceTempIncreasingStream stream if the consecutive average temperature values increase by more than 5 degrees. partition with ( deviceID of TempStream ) begin from TempStream#window.lengthBatch(10) select roomNo, deviceID, avg(temp) as avgTemp insert into #AvgTempStream from every (e1=#AvgTempStream),e2=#AvgTempStream[e1.avgTemp + 5 < avgTemp] select e1.deviceID, e1.avgTemp as initialAvgTemp, e2.avgTemp as finalAvgTemp insert into DeviceTempIncreasingStream end; Table A table is a stored version of an stream or a table of events. Its schema is defined via the table definition that is similar to a stream definition. These events are by default stored in-memory , but Siddhi also provides store extensions to work with data/events stored in various data stores through the table abstraction. Purpose Tables allow Siddhi to work with stored events. By defining a schema for tables Siddhi enables them to be processed by queries using their defined attributes with the streaming data. You can also interactively query the state of the stored events in the table. Syntax The syntax for a new table definition is as follows: define table table name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The following parameters are configured in a table definition: Parameter Description table name The name of the table defined. ( PascalCase is used for table name as a convention.) attribute name The schema of the table is defined by its attributes with uniquely identifiable attribute names ( camelCase is used for attribute names as a convention.) attribute type The type of each attribute defined in the schema. This can be STRING , INT , LONG , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL or OBJECT . Example The following defines a table named RoomTypeTable with roomNo and type attributes of data types int and string respectively. define table RoomTypeTable ( roomNo int , type string ); Primary Keys Tables can be configured with primary keys to avoid the duplication of data. Primary keys are configured by including the @PrimaryKey( 'key1', 'key2' ) annotation to the table definition. Each event table configuration can have only one @PrimaryKey annotation. The number of attributes supported differ based on the table implementations. When more than one attribute is used for the primary key, the uniqueness of the events stored in the table is determined based on the combination of values for those attributes. Examples This query creates an event table with the symbol attribute as the primary key. Therefore each entry in this table must have a unique value for symbol attribute. @ PrimaryKey ( symbol ) define table StockTable ( symbol string , price float , volume long ); Indexes Indexes allow tables to be searched/modified much faster. Indexes are configured by including the @Index( 'key1', 'key2' ) annotation to the table definition. Each event table configuration can have 0-1 @Index annotations. Support for the @Index annotation and the number of attributes supported differ based on the table implementations. When more then one attribute is used for index, each one of them is used to index the table for fast access of the data. Indexes can be configured together with primary keys. Examples This query creates an indexed event table named RoomTypeTable with the roomNo attribute as the index key. @ Index ( roomNo ) define table RoomTypeTable ( roomNo int , type string ); Store Store is a table that refers to data/events stored in data stores outside of Siddhi such as RDBMS, Cassandra, etc. Store is defined via the @store annotation, and the store schema is defined via a table definition associated with it. Purpose Store allows Siddhi to search, retrieve and manipulate data stored in external data stores through Siddhi queries. Syntax The syntax for a defining store and it's associated table definition is as follows: @ store ( type = store_type , static . option . key1 = static_option_value1 , static . option . keyN = static_option_valueN ) define table TableName ( attribute1 Type1 , attributeN TypeN ); Example The following defines a RDBMS data store pointing to a MySQL database with name hotel hosted in loacalhost:3306 having a table RoomTypeTable with columns roomNo of INTEGER and type of VARCHAR(255) mapped to Siddhi data types int and string respectively. @ Store ( type = rdbms , jdbc . url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hotel , username = siddhi , password = 123 , jdbc . driver . name = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver ) define table RoomTypeTable ( roomNo int , type string ); Supported Store Types The following is a list of currently supported store types: RDBMS (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, DB2, H2) Solr MongoDB HBase Redis Cassandra Operators on Table (and Store) The following operators can be performed on tables (and stores). Insert This allows events to be inserted into tables. This is similar to inserting events into streams. Warning If the table is defined with primary keys, and if you insert duplicate data, primary key constrain violations can occur. In such cases use the update or insert into operation. Syntax from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into table Similar to streams, you need to use the current events , expired events or the all events keyword between insert and into keywords in order to insert only the specific output event types. For more information, see output event type Example This query inserts all the events from the TempStream stream to the TempTable table. from TempStream select * insert into TempTable ; Join (Table) This allows a stream to retrieve information from a table in a streaming manner. Note Joins can also be performed with two streams , aggregation or against externally defined windows . Syntax from input stream join table on condition select ( input stream | table ). attribute name , ( input stream | table ). attribute name , ... insert into output stream Note A table can only be joint with a stream. Two tables cannot be joint because there must be at least one active entity to trigger the join operation. Example This Siddhi App performs a join to retrieve the room type from RoomTypeTable table based on the room number, so that it can filter the events related to server-room s. define table RoomTypeTable ( roomNo int , type string ); define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); from TempStream join RoomTypeTable on RoomTypeTable . roomNo == TempStream . roomNo select deviceID , RoomTypeTable . type as roomType , type , temp having roomType == server-room insert into ServerRoomTempStream ; Supported join types Table join supports following join operations. Inner join (join) This is the default behaviour of a join operation. join is used as the keyword to join the stream with the table. The output is generated only if there is a matching event in both the stream and the table. Left outer join The left outer join operation allows you to join a stream on left side with a table on the right side based on a condition. Here, it returns all the events of left stream even if there are no matching events in the right table by having null values for the attributes of the right table. Right outer join This is similar to a left outer join . right outer join is used as the keyword to join a stream on right side with a table on the left side based on a condition. It returns all the events of the right stream even if there are no matching events in the left table. Delete To delete selected events that are stored in a table. Syntax from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... delete table ( for output event type ) ? on condition The condition element specifies the basis on which events are selected to be deleted. When specifying the condition, table attributes should be referred to with the table name. To execute delete for specific output event types, use the current events , expired events or the all events keyword with for as shown in the syntax. For more information, see output event type Note Table attributes must be always referred to with the table name as follows: table name . attibute name Example In this example, the script deletes a record in the RoomTypeTable table if it has a value for the roomNo attribute that matches the value for the roomNumber attribute of an event in the DeleteStream stream. define table RoomTypeTable ( roomNo int , type string ); define stream DeleteStream ( roomNumber int ); from DeleteStream delete RoomTypeTable on RoomTypeTable . roomNo == roomNumber ; Update This operator updates selected event attributes stored in a table based on a condition. Syntax from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... update table ( for output event type ) ? set table . attribute name = ( attribute name | expression ) ? , table . attribute name = ( attribute name | expression ) ? , ... on condition The condition element specifies the basis on which events are selected to be updated. When specifying the condition , table attributes must be referred to with the table name. You can use the set keyword to update selected attributes from the table. Here, for each assignment, the attribute specified in the left must be the table attribute, and the one specified in the right can be a stream/table attribute a mathematical operation, or other. When the set clause is not provided, all the attributes in the table are updated. To execute an update for specific output event types use the current events , expired events or the all events keyword with for as shown in the syntax. For more information, see output event type . Note Table attributes must be always referred to with the table name as shown below: table name . attibute name . Example This Siddhi application updates the room occupancy in the RoomOccupancyTable table for each room number based on new arrivals and exits from the UpdateStream stream. define table RoomOccupancyTable ( roomNo int , people int ); define stream UpdateStream ( roomNumber int , arrival int , exit int ); from UpdateStream select * update RoomOccupancyTable set RoomOccupancyTable . people = RoomOccupancyTable . people + arrival - exit on RoomOccupancyTable . roomNo == roomNumber ; Update or Insert This allows you update if the event attributes already exist in the table based on a condition, or else insert the entry as a new attribute. Syntax from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... update or insert into table ( for output event type ) ? set table . attribute name = expression , table . attribute name = expression , ... on condition The condition element specifies the basis on which events are selected for update. When specifying the condition , table attributes should be referred to with the table name. If a record that matches the condition does not already exist in the table, the arriving event is inserted into the table. The set clause is only used when an update is performed during the insert/update operation. When set clause is used, the attribute to the left is always a table attribute, and the attribute to the right can be a stream/table attribute, mathematical operation or other. The attribute to the left (i.e., the attribute in the event table) is updated with the value of the attribute to the right if the given condition is met. When the set clause is not provided, all the attributes in the table are updated. Note When the attribute to the right is a table attribute, the operations supported differ based on the database type. To execute update upon specific output event types use the current events , expired events or the all events keyword with for as shown in the syntax. To understand more see output event type . Note Table attributes should be always referred to with the table name as table name . attibute name . Example The following query update for events in the UpdateTable event table that have room numbers that match the same in the UpdateStream stream. When such events are found in the event table, they are updated. When a room number available in the stream is not found in the event table, it is inserted from the stream. define table RoomAssigneeTable ( roomNo int , type string , assignee string ); define stream RoomAssigneeStream ( roomNumber int , type string , assignee string ); from RoomAssigneeStream select roomNumber as roomNo , type , assignee update or insert into RoomAssigneeTable set RoomAssigneeTable . assignee = assignee on RoomAssigneeTable . roomNo == roomNo ; In This allows the stream to check whether the expected value exists in the table as a part of a conditional operation. Syntax from input stream [ condition in table ] select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream The condition element specifies the basis on which events are selected to be compared. When constructing the condition , the table attribute must be always referred to with the table name as shown below: table . attibute name . Example This Siddhi application filters only room numbers that are listed in the ServerRoomTable table. define table ServerRoomTable ( roomNo int ); define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); from TempStream [ ServerRoomTable . roomNo == roomNo in ServerRoomTable ] insert into ServerRoomTempStream ; Incremental Aggregation Incremental aggregation allows you to obtain aggregates in an incremental manner for a specified set of time periods. This not only allows you to calculate aggregations with varied time granularity, but also allows you to access them in an interactive manner for reports, dashboards, and for further processing. Its schema is defined via the aggregation definition . Incremental aggregation granularity data holders are automatically purged every 15 minutes. When carrying out data purging, the retention period you have specified for each granularity in the incremental aggregation query is taken into account. The retention period defined for a granularity needs to be greater than or equal to its minimum retention period as specified in the table below. If no valid retention period is defined for a granularity, the default retention period (as specified in the table below) is applied. Granularity Default retention Minimum retention second 120 seconds 120 seconds minute 24 hours 120 minutes hour 30 days 25 hours day 1 year 32 days month All 13 month year All none Purpose Incremental aggregation allows you to retrieve the aggregate values for different time durations. That is, it allows you to obtain aggregates such as sum , count , avg , min , max , count and distinctCount of stream attributes for durations such as sec , min , hour , etc. This is of considerable importance in many Analytics scenarios because aggregate values are often needed for several time periods. Furthermore, this ensures that the aggregations are not lost due to unexpected system failures because aggregates can be stored in different persistence stores . Syntax @ store ( type = store type , ...) @ purge ( enable = true or false , interval = purging interval , @ retentionPeriod ( granularity = retention period , ...) ) define aggregation aggregator name from input stream select attribute name , aggregate function ( attribute name ) as attribute name , ... group by attribute name aggregate by timestamp attribute every time periods ; The above syntax includes the following: Item Description @BufferSize DEPRECIATED FROM V4.2.0 . This identifies the number of expired events to retain in a buffer in order to handle out of order event processing. This is an optional parameter that is applicable only if aggregation is based on external timestamps (because events aggregated based on event arrival time cannot be out of order). Siddhi determines whether an event is expired or not based on the timestamp of the latest event and the most granular duration for which aggregation is calculated. e.g., If the aggregation is calculated for sec\u2026year , the most granular duration is seconds. Therefore, if the buffer size is 3 and events arrive during 51st, 52nd, 53rd and 54th seconds, all of the older aggregations (i.e., for 51st, 52nd and 53rd seconds) are kept in the buffer because the latest event arrived during the 54th second. The default value is 0 . @IgnoreEventsOlderThanBuffer DEPRECIATED FROM V4.2.0 .This annotation specifies whether or not to aggregate events older than the buffer. If this parameter is set to false (which is default), any event older than the buffer is aggregated with the oldest event in buffer. If this parameter is set to true , any event older than the buffer is dropped. This is an optional annotation. @store This annotation is used to refer to the data store where the calculated aggregate results are stored. This annotation is optional. When no annotation is provided, the data is stored in the in-memory store. @purge This annotation is used to configure purging in aggregation granularities. If this annotation is not provided, the default purging mentioned above is applied. If you want to disable automatic data purging, you can use this annotation as follows: '@purge(enable=false) /You should disable data purging if the aggregation query in included in the Siddhi application for read-only purposes. @retentionPeriod This annotation is used to specify the length of time the data needs to be retained when carrying out data purging. If this annotation is not provided, the default retention period is applied. aggregator name This specifies a unique name for the aggregation so that it can be referred when accessing aggregate results. input stream The stream that feeds the aggregation. Note! this stream should be already defined. group by attribute name The group by clause is optional. If it is included in a Siddhi application, aggregate values are calculated per each group by attribute. If it is not used, all the events are aggregated together. by timestamp attribute This clause is optional. This defines the attribute that should be used as the timestamp. If this clause is not used, the event time is used by default. The timestamp could be given as either a string or a long value. If it is a long value, the unix timestamp in milliseconds is expected (e.g. 1496289950000 ). If it is a string value, the supported formats are yyyy - MM - dd HH : mm : ss (if time is in GMT) and yyyy - MM - dd HH : mm : ss Z (if time is not in GMT), here the ISO 8601 UTC offset must be provided for Z . (e.g., +05:30 , -11:00 ). time periods Time periods can be specified as a range where the minimum and the maximum value are separated by three dots, or as comma-separated values. e.g., A range can be specified as sec...year where aggregation is done per second, minute, hour, day, month and year. Comma-separated values can be specified as min, hour. Skipping time durations (e.g., min, day where the hour duration is skipped) when specifying comma-separated values is supported only from v4.1.1 onwards Note From V4.2.0 onwards, aggregation is carried out at calendar start times for each granularity with the GMT timezone Note From V4.2.6 onwards, the same aggregation can be defined in multiple Siddhi apps for joining, however, only one siddhi app should carry out the processing (i.e. the aggregation input stream should only feed events to one aggregation definition). Example This Siddhi Application defines an aggregation named TradeAggregation to calculate the average and sum for the price attribute of events arriving at the TradeStream stream. These aggregates are calculated per every time granularity in the second-year range. define stream TradeStream ( symbol string , price double , volume long , timestamp long ); @ purge ( enable = true , interval = 10 sec , @ retentionPeriod ( sec = 120 sec , min = 24 hours , hours = 30 days , days = 1 year , months = all , years = all )) define aggregation TradeAggregation from TradeStream select symbol , avg ( price ) as avgPrice , sum ( price ) as total group by symbol aggregate by timestamp every sec ... year ; Distributed Aggregation Note Distributed Aggregation is only supported after v4.3.0 Distributed Aggregation allows you to partially process aggregations in different shards. This allows Siddhi app in one shard to be responsible only for processing a part of the aggregation. However for this, all aggregations must be based on a common physical database(@store). Syntax @ store ( type = store type , ...) @ PartitionById define aggregation aggregator name from input stream select attribute name , aggregate function ( attribute name ) as attribute name , ... group by attribute name aggregate by timestamp attribute every time periods ; Following table includes the annotation to be used to enable distributed aggregation, Item Description @PartitionById If the annotation is given, then the distributed aggregation is enabled. Further this can be disabled by using enable element, @PartitionById(enable='false') . Further, following system properties are also available, System Property Description Possible Values Optional Default Value shardId The id of the shard one of the distributed aggregation is running in. This should be unique to a single shard Any string No partitionById This allows user to enable/disable distributed aggregation for all aggregations running in one siddhi manager .(Available from v4.3.3) true/false Yesio false Note ShardIds should not be changed after the first configuration in order to keep data consistency. Join (Aggregation) This allows a stream to retrieve calculated aggregate values from the aggregation. Note A join can also be performed with two streams , with a table and a stream, or with a stream against externally defined windows . Syntax A join with aggregation is similer to the join with table , but with additional within and per clauses. from input stream join aggrigation on join condition within time range per time granularity select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream ; Apart from constructs of table join this includes the following. Please note that the 'on' condition is optional : Item Description within time range This allows you to specify the time interval for which the aggregate values need to be retrieved. This can be specified by providing the start and end time separated by a comma as string or long values, or by using the wildcard string specifying the data range. For details refer examples. per time granularity This specifies the time granularity by which the aggregate values must be grouped and returned. e.g., If you specify days , the retrieved aggregate values are grouped for each day within the selected time interval. AGG_TIMESTAMP This specifies the start time of the aggregations and can be used in the select clause. within and per clauses also accept attribute values from the stream. Note The timestamp of the aggregations can be accessed through the AGG_TIMESTAMP attribute. Example Following aggregation definition will be used for the examples. define stream TradeStream ( symbol string , price double , volume long , timestamp long ); define aggregation TradeAggregation from TradeStream select AGG_TIMESTAMP , symbol , avg ( price ) as avgPrice , sum ( price ) as total group by symbol aggregate by timestamp every sec ... year ; This query retrieves daily aggregations within the time range \"2014-02-15 00:00:00 +05:30\", \"2014-03-16 00:00:00 +05:30\" (Please note that +05:30 can be omitted if timezone is GMT) define stream StockStream ( symbol string , value int ); from StockStream as S join TradeAggregation as T on S . symbol == T . symbol within 2014-02-15 00:00:00 +05:30 , 2014-03-16 00:00:00 +05:30 per days select S . symbol , T . total , T . avgPrice insert into AggregateStockStream ; This query retrieves hourly aggregations within the day 2014-02-15 . define stream StockStream ( symbol string , value int ); from StockStream as S join TradeAggregation as T on S . symbol == T . symbol within 2014-02-15 **:**:** +05:30 per hours select S . symbol , T . total , T . avgPrice insert into AggregateStockStream ; This query retrieves all aggregations per perValue stream attribute within the time period between timestamps 1496200000000 and 1596434876000 . define stream StockStream ( symbol string , value int , perValue string ); from StockStream as S join TradeAggregation as T on S . symbol == T . symbol within 1496200000000 L , 1596434876000 L per S . perValue select S . symbol , T . total , T . avgPrice insert into AggregateStockStream ; Supported join types Aggregation join supports following join operations. Inner join (join) This is the default behaviour of a join operation. join is used as the keyword to join the stream with the aggregation. The output is generated only if there is a matching event in the stream and the aggregation. Left outer join The left outer join operation allows you to join a stream on left side with a aggregation on the right side based on a condition. Here, it returns all the events of left stream even if there are no matching events in the right aggregation by having null values for the attributes of the right aggregation. Right outer join This is similar to a left outer join . right outer join is used as the keyword to join a stream on right side with a aggregation on the left side based on a condition. It returns all the events of the right stream even if there are no matching events in the left aggregation. (Defined) Window A defined window is a window that can be shared across multiple queries. Events can be inserted to a defined window from one or more queries and it can produce output events based on the defined window type. Syntax The syntax for a defined window is as follows: define window window name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ) window type ( parameter , parameter , \u2026 ) output event type ; The following parameters are configured in a table definition: Parameter Description window name The name of the window defined. ( PascalCase is used for window names as a convention.) attribute name The schema of the window is defined by its attributes with uniquely identifiable attribute names ( camelCase is used for attribute names as a convention.) attribute type The type of each attribute defined in the schema. This can be STRING , INT , LONG , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL or OBJECT . window type ( parameter , ...) The window type associated with the window and its parameters. output output event type This is optional. Keywords such as current events , expired events and all events (the default) can be used to specify when the window output should be exposed. For more information, see output event type . Examples Returning all output when events arrive and when events expire from the window. In this query, the output event type is not specified. Therefore, it returns both current and expired events as the output. define window SensorWindow ( name string , value float , roomNo int , deviceID string ) timeBatch ( 1 second ); Returning an output only when events expire from the window. In this query, the output event type of the window is expired events . Therefore, it only returns the events that have expired from the window as the output. define window SensorWindow ( name string , value float , roomNo int , deviceID string ) timeBatch ( 1 second ) output expired events ; Operators on Defined Windows The following operators can be performed on defined windows. Insert This allows events to be inserted into windows. This is similar to inserting events into streams. Syntax from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into window To insert only events of a specific output event type, add the current events , expired events or the all events keyword between insert and into keywords (similar to how it is done for streams). For more information, see output event type . Example This query inserts all events from the TempStream stream to the OneMinTempWindow window. define stream TempStream ( tempId string , temp double ); define window OneMinTempWindow ( tempId string , temp double ) time ( 1 min ); from TempStream select * insert into OneMinTempWindow ; Join (Window) To allow a stream to retrieve information from a window based on a condition. Note A join can also be performed with two streams , aggregation or with tables tables . Syntax from input stream join window on condition select ( input stream | window ). attribute name , ( input stream | window ). attribute name , ... insert into output stream Example This Siddhi Application performs a join count the number of temperature events having more then 40 degrees within the last 2 minutes. define window TwoMinTempWindow ( roomNo int , temp double ) time ( 2 min ); define stream CheckStream ( requestId string ); from CheckStream as C join TwoMinTempWindow as T on T . temp 40 select requestId , count ( T . temp ) as count insert into HighTempCountStream ; Supported join types Window join supports following operations of a join clause. Inner join (join) This is the default behaviour of a join operation. join is used as the keyword to join two windows or a stream with a window. The output is generated only if there is a matching event in both stream/window. Left outer join The left outer join operation allows you to join two windows or a stream with a window to be merged based on a condition. Here, it returns all the events of left stream/window even if there are no matching events in the right stream/window by having null values for the attributes of the right stream/window. Right outer join This is similar to a left outer join. Right outer join is used as the keyword to join two windows or a stream with a window. It returns all the events of the right stream/window even if there are no matching events in the left stream/window. Full outer join The full outer join combines the results of left outer join and right outer join . full outer join is used as the keyword to join two windows or a stream with a window. Here, output event are generated for each incoming event even if there are no matching events in the other stream/window. From A window can be an input to a query, similar to streams. Note !!! When window is used as an input to a query, another window cannot be applied on top of this. Syntax from window select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream Example This Siddhi Application calculates the maximum temperature within the last 5 minutes. define window FiveMinTempWindow ( roomNo int , temp double ) time ( 5 min ); from FiveMinTempWindow select max ( temp ) as maxValue , roomNo insert into MaxSensorReadingStream ; Trigger Triggers allow events to be periodically generated. Trigger definition can be used to define a trigger. A trigger also works like a stream with a predefined schema. Purpose For some use cases the system should be able to periodically generate events based on a specified time interval to perform some periodic executions. A trigger can be performed for a 'start' operation, for a given time interval , or for a given ' cron expression ' . Syntax The syntax for a trigger definition is as follows. define trigger trigger name at ( start | every time interval | cron expression ); Similar to streams, triggers can be used as inputs. They adhere to the following stream definition and produce the triggered_time attribute of the long type. define stream trigger name ( triggered_time long ); The following types of triggeres are currently supported: Trigger type Description 'start' An event is triggered when Siddhi is started. every time interval An event is triggered periodically at the given time interval. ' cron expression ' An event is triggered periodically based on the given cron expression. For configuration details, see quartz-scheduler . Examples Triggering events regularly at specific time intervals The following query triggers events every 5 minutes. define trigger FiveMinTriggerStream at every 5 min ; Triggering events at a specific time on specified days The following query triggers an event at 10.15 AM on every weekdays. define trigger FiveMinTriggerStream at 0 15 10 ? * MON-FRI ; Script Scripts allow you to write functions in other programming languages and execute them within Siddhi queries. Functions defined via scripts can be accessed in queries similar to any other inbuilt function. Function definitions can be used to define these scripts. Function parameters are passed into the function logic as Object[] and with the name data . Purpose Scripts allow you to define a function operation that is not provided in Siddhi core or its extension. It is not required to write an extension to define the function logic. Syntax The syntax for a Script definition is as follows. define function function name [ language name ] return return type { operation of the function } ; The following parameters are configured when defining a script. Parameter Description function name The name of the function ( camelCase is used for the function name) as a convention. language name The name of the programming language used to define the script, such as javascript , r and scala . return type The attribute type of the function\u2019s return. This can be int , long , float , double , string , bool or object . Here the function implementer should be responsible for returning the output attribute on the defined return type for proper functionality. operation of the function Here, the execution logic of the function is added. This logic should be written in the language specified under the language name , and it should return the output in the data type specified via the return type parameter. Examples This query performs concatenation using JavaScript, and returns the output as a string. define function concatFn [ javascript ] return string { var str1 = data [ 0 ]; var str2 = data [ 1 ]; var str3 = data [ 2 ]; var responce = str1 + str2 + str3 ; return responce ; } ; define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); from TempStream select concatFn ( roomNo , - , deviceID ) as id , temp insert into DeviceTempStream ; Store Query Siddhi store queries are a set of on-demand queries that can be used to perform operations on Siddhi tables, windows, and aggregators. Purpose Store queries allow you to execute the following operations on Siddhi tables, windows, and aggregators without the intervention of streams. Queries supported for tables: SELECT INSERT DELETE UPDATE UPDATE OR INSERT Queries supported for windows and aggregators: SELECT This is be done by submitting the store query to the Siddhi application runtime using its query() method. In order to execute store queries, the Siddhi application of the Siddhi application runtime you are using, should have a store defined, which contains the table that needs to be queried. Example If you need to query the table named RoomTypeTable the it should have been defined in the Siddhi application. In order to execute a store query on RoomTypeTable , you need to submit the store query using query() method of SiddhiAppRuntime instance as below. siddhiAppRuntime . query ( store query ); (Table/Window) Select The SELECT store query retrieves records from the specified table or window, based on the given condition. Syntax from table / window on condition ? select attribute name , attribute name , ... group by ? having ? order by ? limit ? Example This query retrieves room numbers and types of the rooms starting from room no 10. from roomTypeTable on roomNo = 10 ; select roomNo , type (Aggregation) Select The SELECT store query retrieves records from the specified aggregation, based on the given condition, time range, and granularity. Syntax from aggregation on condition ? within time range per time granularity select attribute name , attribute name , ... group by ? having ? order by ? limit ? Example Following aggregation definition will be used for the examples. define stream TradeStream ( symbol string , price double , volume long , timestamp long ); define aggregation TradeAggregation from TradeStream select symbol , avg ( price ) as avgPrice , sum ( price ) as total group by symbol aggregate by timestamp every sec ... year ; This query retrieves daily aggregations within the time range \"2014-02-15 00:00:00 +05:30\", \"2014-03-16 00:00:00 +05:30\" (Please note that +05:30 can be omitted if timezone is GMT) from TradeAggregation within 2014-02-15 00:00:00 +05:30 , 2014-03-16 00:00:00 +05:30 per days select symbol , total , avgPrice ; This query retrieves hourly aggregations of \"FB\" symbol within the day 2014-02-15 . from TradeAggregation on symbol == FB within 2014-02-15 **:**:** +05:30 per hours select symbol , total , avgPrice ; Insert This allows you to insert a new record to the table with the attribute values you define in the select section. Syntax select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into table ; Example This store query inserts a new record to the table RoomOccupancyTable , with the specified attribute values. select 10 as roomNo , 2 as people insert into RoomOccupancyTable Delete The DELETE store query deletes selected records from a specified table. Syntax select ? delete table on conditional expresssion The condition element specifies the basis on which records are selected to be deleted. Note Table attributes must always be referred to with the table name as shown below: table name . attibute name . Example In this example, query deletes a record in the table named RoomTypeTable if it has value for the roomNo attribute that matches the value for the roomNumber attribute of the selection which has 10 as the actual value. select 10 as roomNumber delete RoomTypeTable on RoomTypeTable . roomNo == roomNumber ; delete RoomTypeTable on RoomTypeTable . roomNo == 10 ; Update The UPDATE store query updates selected attributes stored in a specific table, based on a given condition. Syntax select attribute name , attribute name , ... ? update table set table . attribute name = ( attribute name | expression ) ? , table . attribute name = ( attribute name | expression ) ? , ... on condition The condition element specifies the basis on which records are selected to be updated. When specifying the condition , table attributes must be referred to with the table name. You can use the set keyword to update selected attributes from the table. Here, for each assignment, the attribute specified in the left must be the table attribute, and the one specified in the right can be a stream/table attribute a mathematical operation, or other. When the set clause is not provided, all the attributes in the table are updated. Note Table attributes must always be referred to with the table name as shown below: table name . attibute name . Example The following query updates the room occupancy by increasing the value of people by 1, in the RoomOccupancyTable table for each room number greater than 10. select 10 as roomNumber , 1 as arrival update RoomTypeTable set RoomTypeTable . people = RoomTypeTable . people + arrival on RoomTypeTable . roomNo == roomNumber ; update RoomTypeTable set RoomTypeTable . people = RoomTypeTable . people + 1 on RoomTypeTable . roomNo == 10 ; Update or Insert This allows you to update selected attributes if a record that meets the given conditions already exists in the specified table. If a matching record does not exist, the entry is inserted as a new record. Syntax select attribute name , attribute name , ... update or insert into table set table . attribute name = expression , table . attribute name = expression , ... on condition The condition element specifies the basis on which records are selected for update. When specifying the condition , table attributes should be referred to with the table name. If a record that matches the condition does not already exist in the table, the arriving event is inserted into the table. The set clause is only used when an update is performed during the insert/update operation. When set clause is used, the attribute to the left is always a table attribute, and the attribute to the right can be a stream/table attribute, mathematical operation or other. The attribute to the left (i.e., the attribute in the event table) is updated with the value of the attribute to the right if the given condition is met. When the set clause is not provided, all the attributes in the table are updated. Note Table attributes must always be referred to with the table name as shown below: table name . attibute name . Example The following query tries to update the records in the RoomAssigneeTable table that have room numbers that match the same in the selection. If such records are not found, it inserts a new record based on the values provided in the selection. select 10 as roomNo , single as type , abc as assignee update or insert into RoomAssigneeTable set RoomAssigneeTable . assignee = assignee on RoomAssigneeTable . roomNo == roomNo ; Extensions Siddhi supports an extension architecture to enhance its functionality by incorporating other libraries in a seamless manner. Purpose Extensions are supported because, Siddhi core cannot have all the functionality that's needed for all the use cases, mostly use cases require different type of functionality, and for some cases there can be gaps and you need to write the functionality by yourself. All extensions have a namespace. This is used to identify the relevant extensions together, and to let you specifically call the extension. Syntax Extensions follow the following syntax; namespace : function name ( parameter , parameter , ... ) The following parameters are configured when referring a script function. Parameter Description namespace Allows Siddhi to identify the extension without conflict function name The name of the function referred. parameter The function input parameter for function execution. Extension Types Siddhi supports following extension types: Function For each event, it consumes zero or more parameters as input parameters and returns a single attribute. This can be used to manipulate existing event attributes to generate new attributes like any Function operation. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.executor.function.FunctionExecutor . Example : math:sin(x) Here, the sin function of math extension returns the sin value for the x parameter. Aggregate Function For each event, it consumes zero or more parameters as input parameters and returns a single attribute with aggregated results. This can be used in conjunction with a window in order to find the aggregated results based on the given window like any Aggregate Function operation. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.selector.attribute.aggregator.AttributeAggregatorExecutor . Example : custom:std(x) Here, the std aggregate function of custom extension returns the standard deviation of the x value based on its assigned window query. Window This allows events to be collected, generated, dropped and expired anytime without altering the event format based on the given input parameters, similar to any other Window operator. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.window.WindowProcessor . Example : custom:unique(key) Here, the unique window of the custom extension retains one event for each unique key parameter. Stream Function This allows events to be generated or dropped only during event arrival and altered by adding one or more attributes to it. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.function.StreamFunctionProcessor . Example : custom:pol2cart(theta,rho) Here, the pol2cart function of the custom extension returns all the events by calculating the cartesian coordinates x y and adding them as new attributes to the events. Stream Processor This allows events to be collected, generated, dropped and expired anytime by altering the event format by adding one or more attributes to it based on the given input parameters. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.StreamProcessor . Example : custom:perMinResults( parameter , parameter , ...) Here, the perMinResults function of the custom extension returns all events by adding one or more attributes to the events based on the conversion logic. Altered events are output every minute regardless of event arrivals. Sink Sinks provide a way to publish Siddhi events to external systems in the preferred data format. Sinks publish events from the streams via multiple transports to external endpoints in various data formats. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.Sink . Example : @sink(type='sink_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') To configure a stream to publish events via a sink, add the sink configuration to a stream definition by adding the @sink annotation with the required parameter values. The sink syntax is as above Source Source allows Siddhi to consume events from external systems , and map the events to adhere to the associated stream. Sources receive events via multiple transports and in various data formats, and direct them into streams for processing. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.input.source.Source . Example : @source(type='source_type', static.option.key1='static_option_value1') To configure a stream that consumes events via a source, add the source configuration to a stream definition by adding the @source annotation with the required parameter values. The source syntax is as above Store You can use Store extension type to work with data/events stored in various data stores through the table abstraction . You can find more information about these extension types under the heading 'Extension types' in this document. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.table.record.AbstractRecordTable . Script Scripts allow you to define a function operation that is not provided in Siddhi core or its extension. It is not required to write an extension to define the function logic. Scripts allow you to write functions in other programming languages and execute them within Siddhi queries. Functions defined via scripts can be accessed in queries similar to any other inbuilt function. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.function.Script . Source Mapper Each @source configuration has a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that converts the incoming messages format to Siddhi events .The type parameter of the @map defines the map type to be used to map the data. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.SourceMapper . Example : @map(type='map_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') Sink Mapper Each @sink configuration has a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that converts the outgoing Siddhi events to configured messages format .The type parameter of the @map defines the map type to be used to map the data. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.SinkMapper . Example : @map(type='map_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') Example A window extension created with namespace foo and function name unique can be referred as follows: from StockExchangeStream [ price = 20 ] # window . foo : unique ( symbol ) select symbol , price insert into StockQuote Available Extensions Siddhi currently has several pre written extensions that are available here We value your contribution on improving Siddhi and its extensions further. Writing Custom Extensions Custom extensions can be written in order to cater use case specific logic that are not available in Siddhi out of the box or as an existing extension. There are five types of Siddhi extensions that you can write to cater your specific use cases. These extension types and the related maven archetypes are given below. You can use these archetypes to generate Maven projects for each extension type. Follow the procedure for the required archetype, based on your project: Note When using the generated archetype please make sure you complete the @Extension annotation with proper values. This annotation will be used to identify and document the extension, hence your extension will not work without @Extension annotation. siddhi-execution Siddhi-execution provides following extension types: Function Aggregate Function Stream Function Stream Processor Window You can use one or more from above mentioned extension types and implement according to your requirement.

If not, press N . Configuring and Monitoring Siddhi Applications Threading and Asynchronous When @Async annotation is added to the Streams it enable the Streams to introduce asynchronous and multi-threading behaviour. @ Async ( buffer . size = 256 , workers = 2 , batch . size . max = 5 ) define stream stream name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The following elements are configured with this annotation. Annotation Description Default Value buffer.size The size of the event buffer that will be used to handover the execution to other threads. - workers Number of worker threads that will be be used to process the buffered events. 1 batch.size.max The maximum number of events that will be processed together by a worker thread at a given time. buffer.size Fault Streams When the @OnError annotation is added to a stream definition, it handles failover scenarios that occur during runtime gracefully. @ OnError ( action = on_error_action ) define stream stream name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The action parameter of the @OnError annotation defines the action to be executed during failure scenarios. The following action types can be specified via the @OnError annotation when defining a stream. If this annotation is not added, LOG is the action type by default. LOG : Logs the event with an error, and then drops the event. STREAM : A fault stream is automatically created for the base stream. The definition of the fault stream includes all the attributes of the base stream as well as an additional attribute named _error . The events are inserted into the fault stream during a failure. The error identified is captured as the value for the _error attribute. e.g., the following is a Siddhi application that includes the @OnError annotation to handle failures during runtime. @ OnError ( name = STREAM ) define stream StreamA ( symbol string , volume long ); from StreamA [ custom : fault () volume ] insert into StreamB ; from ! StreamA # log ( Error Occured ) select symbol , volume long , _error insert into tempStream ; !StreamA , fault stream is automatically created when you add the @OnError annotation with the following attributes. symbol string , volume long , _error object If you include the on.error parameter in the sink configuration, failures are handled by Siddhi at the time the events are published from the Sink . @ sink ( type = sink_type , on . error = on.error.action ) define stream stream name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The action types that can be specified via the on.error parameter when configuring a sink are as follows. If this parameter is not included in the sink configuration, LOG is the action type by default. LOG : Logs the event with the error, and then drops the event. WAIT : The thread waits in the back-off and re-trying state, and reconnects once the connection is re-established. STREAM : Corresponding fault stream is populated with the failed event and the error while publishing. Statistics Use @app:statistics app level annotation to evaluate the performance of an application, you can enable the statistics of a Siddhi application to be published. This is done via the @app:statistics annotation that can be added to a Siddhi application as shown in the following example. @ app : statistics ( reporter = console ) The following elements are configured with this annotation. Annotation Description Default Value reporter The interface in which statistics for the Siddhi application are published. Possible values are as follows: console jmx console interval The time interval (in seconds) at which the statistics for the Siddhi application are reported. 60 include If this parameter is added, only the types of metrics you specify are included in the reporting. The required metric types can be specified as a comma-separated list. It is also possible to use wild cards All ( . ) The metrics are reported in the following format. io.siddhi.SiddhiApps.

Purpose Each Siddhi Application is an isolated processing unit that allows you to deploy and execute queries independent of other Siddhi applications in the system. The following diagram depicts how event flows work with some of the key Siddhi Streaming SQL elements of the Siddhi Application. Below table provides brief description of a few key elements in the Siddhi Streaming SQL Language. Elements Description Stream A logical series of events ordered in time with a uniquely identifiable name, and set of defined attributes with specific data types defining its schema. Event An event is associated with only one stream, and all events of that stream have an identical set of attributes that are assigned specific types (or the same schema). An event contains a timestamp and set of attribute values according to the schema. Table A structured representation of data stored with a defined schema. Stored data can be backed by In-Memory , RDBMs , MongoDB , etc. to be accessed and manipulated at runtime. Query A logical construct that processes events in streaming manner by combining existing streams and/or tables, and generates events to an output stream or table. A query consumes one or more input streams, and zero or one table. Then it processes these events in a streaming manner and publishes the output events to streams or tables for further processing or to generate notifications. Source A contract that consumes data from external sources (such as TCP , Kafka , HTTP , etc)in the form of events, then converts each event (which can be in XML , JSON , binary , etc. format) to a Siddhi event, and passes that to a Stream for processing. Sink A contract that takes events arriving at a stream, maps them to a predefined data format (such as XML , JSON , binary , etc), and publishes them to external endpoints (such as E-mail , TCP , Kafka , HTTP , etc). Input Handler A mechanism to programmatically inject events into streams. Stream/Query Callback A mechanism to programmatically consume output events from streams and queries. Partition A logical container that isolates the processing of queries based on partition keys. Here, a separate instance of queries is generated for each partition key to achieve isolation. Inner Stream A positionable stream that connects portioned queries within their partitions, preserving isolation. Grammar An element of Siddhi SQL can be composed together as a script in a Siddhi application, Here each construct must be separated by a semicolon ( ; ) as shown in the below syntax. siddhi app : app annotation * ( stream definition | table definition | ... ) + ( query | partition ) + ; Example Siddhi Application named Temperature-Analytics defined with a stream named TempStream and a query named 5minAvgQuery for processing it. @ app : name ( Temperature-Analytics ) define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); @ name ( 5minAvgQuery ) from TempStream # window . time ( 5 min ) select roomNo , avg ( temp ) as avgTemp group by roomNo insert into OutputStream ;","title":"Siddhi Application"},{"location":"documentation/siddhi-4.x/query-guide-4.x/#stream","text":"A stream is a logical series of events ordered in time. Its schema is defined via the stream definition . A stream definition contains a unique name and a set of attributes with specific types and uniquely identifiable names within the stream. All the events that are selected to be received into a specific stream have the same schema (i.e., have the same attributes in the same order). Purpose By defining a schema it unifies common types of events together. This enables them to be processed via queries using their defined attributes in a streaming manner, and allow sinks and sources to map events to/from various data formats. Syntax The syntax for defining a new stream is as follows. define stream stream name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The following parameters are configured in a stream definition. Parameter Description stream name The name of the stream created. (It is recommended to define a stream name in PascalCase .) attribute name The schema of an stream is defined by its attributes with uniquely identifiable attribute names. (It is recommended to define attribute names in camelCase .) attribute type The type of each attribute defined in the schema. This can be STRING , INT , LONG , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL or OBJECT . To use and refer stream and attribute names that do not follow [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]* format enclose them in `. E.g. ``` $test(0)` ```. To make the stream process events in asynchronous and multi-threading manner use the @Async annotation as shown in Threading and Asynchronous configuration section.

A source configuration allows you to define a mapping in order to convert each incoming event from its native data format to a Siddhi event. When customizations to such mappings are not provided, Siddhi assumes that the arriving event adheres to the predefined format based on the stream definition and the selected message format. Purpose Source allows Siddhi to consume events from external systems, and map the events to adhere to the associated stream. Syntax To configure a stream that consumes events via a source, add the source configuration to a stream definition by adding the @source annotation with the required parameter values. The source syntax is as follows: @ source ( type = source_type , static . option . key1 = static_option_value1 , static . option . keyN = static_option_valueN , @ map ( type = map_type , static . option_key1 = static_option_value1 , static . option . keyN = static_option_valueN , @ attributes ( attributeN = attribute_mapping_N , attribute1 = attribute_mapping_1 ) ) ) define stream StreamName ( attribute1 Type1 , attributeN TypeN ); This syntax includes the following annotations. Source The type parameter of @source defines the source type that receives events. The other parameters to be configured depends on the source type selected, some of the the parameters are optional.

This default mapper type can be used when source consumes Siddhi events and when it does not need any mappings. Map Attributes @attributes is an optional annotation used with @map to define custom mapping. When @attributes is not provided, each mapper assumes that the incoming events adhere to its own default data format. By adding the @attributes annotation, you can configure mappers to extract data from the incoming message selectively, and assign them to attributes. There are two ways you can configure map attributes.

Purpose Sinks provide a way to publish Siddhi events to external systems in the preferred data format. Syntax To configure a stream to publish events via a sink, add the sink configuration to a stream definition by adding the @sink annotation with the required parameter values.

Example The following query calculates the average temperature per roomNo and deviceID combination, for events that arrive at the TempStream stream for every 10 minutes and emits two events with highest average temperature. from TempStream # window . timeBatch ( 10 min ) select avg ( temp ) as avgTemp , roomNo , deviceID group by roomNo , deviceID order by avgTemp desc limit 2 insert into HighestAvgTempStream ; The following query calculates the average temperature per roomNo and deviceID combination, for events that arrive at the TempStream stream for every 10 minutes and emits third, forth and fifth events when sorted in descending order based on their average temperature. from TempStream # window . timeBatch ( 10 min ) select avg ( temp ) as avgTemp , roomNo , deviceID group by roomNo , deviceID order by avgTemp desc limit 3 offset 2 insert into HighestAvgTempStream ;","title":"Limit &amp; Offset"},{"location":"documentation/siddhi-4.x/query-guide-4.x/#join-stream","text":"Joins allow you to get a combined result from two streams in real-time based on a specified condition. Purpose Streams are stateless. Therefore, in order to join two streams, they need to be connected to a window so that there is a pool of events that can be used for joining. Joins also accept conditions to join the appropriate events from each stream. During the joining process each incoming event of each stream is matched against all the events in the other stream's window based on the given condition, and the output events are generated for all the matching event pairs. Note Join can also be performed with stored data , aggregation or externally defined windows . Syntax The syntax for a join is as follows: from input stream # window . window name ( parameter , ... ) { unidirectional } { as reference } join input stream # window . window name ( parameter , ... ) { unidirectional } { as reference } on join condition select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream Here, the join condition allows you to match the attributes from both the streams. Unidirectional join operation By default, events arriving at either stream can trigger the joining process. However, if you want to control the join execution, you can add the unidirectional keyword next to a stream in the join definition as depicted in the syntax in order to enable that stream to trigger the join operation. Here, events arriving at other stream only update the window of that stream, and this stream does not trigger the join operation. Note The unidirectional keyword cannot be applied to both the input streams because the default behaviour already allows both streams to trigger the join operation. Example Assuming that the temperature of regulators are updated every minute. Following is a Siddhi App that controls the temperature regulators if they are not already on for all the rooms with a room temperature greater than 30 degrees. define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); define stream RegulatorStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , isOn bool ); from TempStream [ temp 30 . 0 ] # window . time ( 1 min ) as T join RegulatorStream [ isOn == false ] # window . length ( 1 ) as R on T . roomNo == R . roomNo select T . roomNo , R . deviceID , start as action insert into RegulatorActionStream ; Supported join types Following are the supported operations of a join clause. Inner join (join) This is the default behaviour of a join operation. join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. The output is generated only if there is a matching event in both the streams. Left outer join The left outer join operation allows you to join two streams to be merged based on a condition. left outer join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. Here, it returns all the events of left stream even if there are no matching events in the right stream by having null values for the attributes of the right stream. Example The following query generates output events for all events from the StockStream stream regardless of whether a matching symbol exists in the TwitterStream stream or not. from StockStream#window.time(1 min) as S left outer join TwitterStream#window.length(1) as T on S.symbol== T.symbol select S.symbol as symbol, T.tweet, S.price insert into outputStream ; Right outer join This is similar to a left outer join. Right outer join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. It returns all the events of the right stream even if there are no matching events in the left stream. Full outer join The full outer join combines the results of left outer join and right outer join. full outer join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. Here, output event are generated for each incoming event even if there are no matching events in the other stream. Example The following query generates output events for all the incoming events of each stream regardless of whether there is a match for the symbol attribute in the other stream or not. from StockStream#window.time(1 min) as S full outer join TwitterStream#window.length(1) as T on S.symbol== T.symbol select S.symbol as symbol, T.tweet, S.price insert into outputStream ;","title":"Join (Stream)"},{"location":"documentation/siddhi-4.x/query-guide-4.x/#pattern","text":"This is a state machine implementation that allows you to detect patterns in the events that arrive over time.

Primary keys are configured by including the @PrimaryKey( 'key1', 'key2' ) annotation to the table definition. Each event table configuration can have only one @PrimaryKey annotation.

This not only allows you to calculate aggregations with varied time granularity, but also allows you to access them in an interactive manner for reports, dashboards, and for further processing. Its schema is defined via the aggregation definition . Incremental aggregation granularity data holders are automatically purged every 15 minutes. When carrying out data purging, the retention period you have specified for each granularity in the incremental aggregation query is taken into account. The retention period defined for a granularity needs to be greater than or equal to its minimum retention period as specified in the table below. If no valid retention period is defined for a granularity, the default retention period (as specified in the table below) is applied. Granularity Default retention Minimum retention second 120 seconds 120 seconds minute 24 hours 120 minutes hour 30 days 25 hours day 1 year 32 days month All 13 month year All none Purpose Incremental aggregation allows you to retrieve the aggregate values for different time durations. That is, it allows you to obtain aggregates such as sum , count , avg , min , max , count and distinctCount of stream attributes for durations such as sec , min , hour , etc. This is of considerable importance in many Analytics scenarios because aggregate values are often needed for several time periods. Furthermore, this ensures that the aggregations are not lost due to unexpected system failures because aggregates can be stored in different persistence stores . Syntax @ store ( type = store type , ...) @ purge ( enable = true or false , interval = purging interval , @ retentionPeriod ( granularity = retention period , ...) ) define aggregation aggregator name from input stream select attribute name , aggregate function ( attribute name ) as attribute name , ... group by attribute name aggregate by timestamp attribute every time periods ; The above syntax includes the following: Item Description @BufferSize DEPRECIATED FROM V4.2.0 . This identifies the number of expired events to retain in a buffer in order to handle out of order event processing. This is an optional parameter that is applicable only if aggregation is based on external timestamps (because events aggregated based on event arrival time cannot be out of order). Siddhi determines whether an event is expired or not based on the timestamp of the latest event and the most granular duration for which aggregation is calculated. e.g., If the aggregation is calculated for sec\u2026year , the most granular duration is seconds. Therefore, if the buffer size is 3 and events arrive during 51st, 52nd, 53rd and 54th seconds, all of the older aggregations (i.e., for 51st, 52nd and 53rd seconds) are kept in the buffer because the latest event arrived during the 54th second. The default value is 0 . @IgnoreEventsOlderThanBuffer DEPRECIATED FROM V4.2.0 .This annotation specifies whether or not to aggregate events older than the buffer. If this parameter is set to false (which is default), any event older than the buffer is aggregated with the oldest event in buffer. If this parameter is set to true , any event older than the buffer is dropped. This is an optional annotation. @store This annotation is used to refer to the data store where the calculated aggregate results are stored. This annotation is optional. When no annotation is provided, the data is stored in the in-memory store. @purge This annotation is used to configure purging in aggregation granularities.

If you want to disable automatic data purging, you can use this annotation as follows: '@purge(enable=false) /You should disable data purging if the aggregation query in included in the Siddhi application for read-only purposes. @retentionPeriod This annotation is used to specify the length of time the data needs to be retained when carrying out data purging. If this annotation is not provided, the default retention period is applied. aggregator name This specifies a unique name for the aggregation so that it can be referred when accessing aggregate results. input stream The stream that feeds the aggregation. Note! this stream should be already defined. group by attribute name The group by clause is optional. If it is included in a Siddhi application, aggregate values are calculated per each group by attribute. If it is not used, all the events are aggregated together. by timestamp attribute This clause is optional. This defines the attribute that should be used as the timestamp. If this clause is not used, the event time is used by default. The timestamp could be given as either a string or a long value. If it is a long value, the unix timestamp in milliseconds is expected (e.g. 1496289950000 ).

(e.g., +05:30 , -11:00 ). time periods Time periods can be specified as a range where the minimum and the maximum value are separated by three dots, or as comma-separated values. e.g., A range can be specified as sec...year where aggregation is done per second, minute, hour, day, month and year. Comma-separated values can be specified as min, hour.

This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.selector.attribute.aggregator.AttributeAggregatorExecutor . Example : custom:std(x) Here, the std aggregate function of custom extension returns the standard deviation of the x value based on its assigned window query. Window This allows events to be collected, generated, dropped and expired anytime without altering the event format based on the given input parameters, similar to any other Window operator. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.window.WindowProcessor . Example : custom:unique(key) Here, the unique window of the custom extension retains one event for each unique key parameter. Stream Function This allows events to be generated or dropped only during event arrival and altered by adding one or more attributes to it. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.function.StreamFunctionProcessor . Example : custom:pol2cart(theta,rho) Here, the pol2cart function of the custom extension returns all the events by calculating the cartesian coordinates x y and adding them as new attributes to the events. Stream Processor This allows events to be collected, generated, dropped and expired anytime by altering the event format by adding one or more attributes to it based on the given input parameters. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.StreamProcessor . Example : custom:perMinResults( parameter , parameter , ...) Here, the perMinResults function of the custom extension returns all events by adding one or more attributes to the events based on the conversion logic. Altered events are output every minute regardless of event arrivals. Sink Sinks provide a way to publish Siddhi events to external systems in the preferred data format. Sinks publish events from the streams via multiple transports to external endpoints in various data formats. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.Sink . Example : @sink(type='sink_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') To configure a stream to publish events via a sink, add the sink configuration to a stream definition by adding the @sink annotation with the required parameter values. The sink syntax is as above Source Source allows Siddhi to consume events from external systems , and map the events to adhere to the associated stream. Sources receive events via multiple transports and in various data formats, and direct them into streams for processing. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.input.source.Source . Example : @source(type='source_type', static.option.key1='static_option_value1') To configure a stream that consumes events via a source, add the source configuration to a stream definition by adding the @source annotation with the required parameter values. The source syntax is as above Store You can use Store extension type to work with data/events stored in various data stores through the table abstraction . You can find more information about these extension types under the heading 'Extension types' in this document. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.table.record.AbstractRecordTable . Script Scripts allow you to define a function operation that is not provided in Siddhi core or its extension. It is not required to write an extension to define the function logic. Scripts allow you to write functions in other programming languages and execute them within Siddhi queries. Functions defined via scripts can be accessed in queries similar to any other inbuilt function. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.function.Script . Source Mapper Each @source configuration has a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that converts the incoming messages format to Siddhi events .The type parameter of the @map defines the map type to be used to map the data. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.SourceMapper . Example : @map(type='map_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') Sink Mapper Each @sink configuration has a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that converts the outgoing Siddhi events to configured messages format .The type parameter of the @map defines the map type to be used to map the data. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.SinkMapper . Example : @map(type='map_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') Example A window extension created with namespace foo and function name unique can be referred as follows: from StockExchangeStream [ price = 20 ] # window . foo : unique ( symbol ) select symbol , price insert into StockQuote Available Extensions Siddhi currently has several pre written extensions that are available here We value your contribution on improving Siddhi and its extensions further.","title":"Extensions"},{"location":"documentation/siddhi-4.x/query-guide-4.x/#writing-custom-extensions","text":"Custom extensions can be written in order to cater use case specific logic that are not available in Siddhi out of the box or as an existing extension.

All none GPL Siddhi extensions are shipped by default with WSO2 Stream Processor, and you can add other Siddhi extensions or upgrade existing Siddhi extensions, by removing and adding relevant Siddhi extension and its dependent OSGi bundles to SP_HOME /lib directory. If the Siddhi Extension depends on non OSGi jars convert them to OSGi bundles by following the steps provided in the SP docs . Refer the WSO2 SP Quick Start Guide to try out Siddhi within WSO2 Stream Processor. Refer WSO2 Stream Processor Documentation for more information. Using Siddhi as a java library To embed Siddhi as a java library into your project and to get a working sample follow the bellow steps: Step 1: Creating a Java Project Create a Java project using Maven and include the following dependencies in its pom.xml file. dependency groupId org.wso2.siddhi /groupId artifactId siddhi-core /artifactId version 4.x.x /version /dependency dependency groupId org.wso2.siddhi /groupId artifactId siddhi-query-api /artifactId version 4.x.x /version /dependency dependency groupId org.wso2.siddhi /groupId artifactId siddhi-query-compiler /artifactId version 4.x.x /version /dependency dependency groupId org.wso2.siddhi /groupId artifactId siddhi-annotations /artifactId version 4.x.x /version /dependency Note : You can create the Java project using any method you prefer. The required dependencies can be downloaded from here . * Create a new Java class in the Maven project. Step 2: Creating Siddhi Application A Siddhi application is a self contained execution entity that defines how data is captured, processed and sent out. Create a Siddhi Application by defining a stream definition E.g. StockEventStream defining the format of the incoming events, and by defining a Siddhi query as follows. String siddhiApp = define stream StockEventStream (symbol string, price float, volume long); + + @info(name = query1 ) + from StockEventStream#window.time(5 sec) + select symbol, sum(price) as price, sum(volume) as volume + group by symbol + insert into AggregateStockStream ; ; This Siddhi query groups the events by symbol and calculates aggregates such as the sum for price and sum of volume for the last 5 seconds time window. Then it inserts the results into a stream named AggregateStockStream . Step 3: Creating Siddhi Application Runtime This step involves creating a runtime representation of a Siddhi application. SiddhiManager siddhiManager = new SiddhiManager (); SiddhiAppRuntime siddhiAppRuntime = siddhiManager . createSiddhiAppRuntime ( siddhiApp ); The Siddhi Manager parses the Siddhi application and provides you with an Siddhi application runtime. This Siddhi application runtime can be used to add callbacks and input handlers such that you can programmatically invoke the Siddhi application. Step 4: Registering a Callback You can register a callback to the Siddhi application runtime in order to receive the results once the events are processed. There are two types of callbacks: Query callback : This subscribes to a query. Stream callback : This subscribes to an event stream. In this example, a Stream callback is added to the AggregateStockStream to capture the processed events. siddhiAppRuntime . addCallback ( AggregateStockStream , new StreamCallback () { @Override public void receive ( Event [] events ) { EventPrinter . print ( events ); } }); Here, once the results are generated they are sent to the receive method of this callback. An event printer is added inside this callback to print the incoming events for demonstration purposes. Step 5: Sending Events In order to programmatically send events from the stream you need to obtain it's an input handler as follows: InputHandler inputHandler = siddhiAppRuntime . getInputHandler ( StockEventStream ); Use the following code to start the Siddhi application runtime, send events and to shutdown Siddhi: //Start SiddhiApp runtime siddhiAppRuntime . start (); //Sending events to Siddhi inputHandler . send ( new Object []{ IBM , 100 f , 100L }); Thread . sleep ( 1000 ); inputHandler . send ( new Object []{ IBM , 200 f , 300L }); inputHandler . send ( new Object []{ WSO2 , 60 f , 200L }); Thread . sleep ( 1000 ); inputHandler . send ( new Object []{ WSO2 , 70 f , 400L }); inputHandler . send ( new Object []{ GOOG , 50 f , 30L }); Thread . sleep ( 1000 ); inputHandler . send ( new Object []{ IBM , 200 f , 400L }); Thread . sleep ( 2000 ); inputHandler . send ( new Object []{ WSO2 , 70 f , 50L }); Thread . sleep ( 2000 ); inputHandler . send ( new Object []{ WSO2 , 80 f , 400L }); inputHandler . send ( new Object []{ GOOG , 60 f , 30L }); Thread . sleep ( 1000 ); //Shutdown SiddhiApp runtime siddhiAppRuntime . shutdown (); //Shutdown Siddhi siddhiManager . shutdown (); When the events are sent, you can see the output logged by the event printer.

Achieve high performance by processing events in-memory and using data stores for long term data storage. Optimize performance by enforcing a strict event stream schema and by pre-compiling the queries. Optimize memory consumption by having only the absolutely necessary information in-memory and dropping the rest as soon as possible. Supporting multiple extension points to accommodate a diverse set of functionality such as supporting multiple sources, sinks, functions, aggregation operations, windows, etc. High-Level Architecture At a high level, Siddhi consumes events from various events sources, processes them according to the defined Siddhi application, and produces results to the subscribed event sinks. Siddhi can store and consume events from in-memory tables or from external data stores such as RDBMS , MongoDB , Hazelcast in-memory grid, etc. (i.e., when configured to do so). Siddhi also allows applications and users to query Siddhi via its Store Query API to interactively retrieve data from in-memory and other stores. Main Modules in Siddhi Engine Siddhi Engine comprises four main modules, they are: Siddhi Query API : This allows users to define the execution logic of the Siddhi application as queries and definitions using POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects). Internally, Siddhi uses these objects to identify the logic that it is expected to perform. Siddhi Query Compiler : This allows users to define the Siddhi application using the Siddhi Streaming SQL, and it compiles the Streaming SQL script to Siddhi Query API POJOs so that Siddhi can execute them. Siddhi Core : This builds the execution runtime based on the defined Siddhi Application POJOs and processes the incoming events as and when they arrive. Siddhi Annotation : This is a helper module that allows all extensions to be annotated so that they can be picked by Siddhi Core for processing. This also helps Siddhi to generate the extension documentation. Siddhi Component Architecture The following diagram illustrates the main components of Siddhi and how they work together. Here the Siddhi Core module maintains the execution logic. It also interacts with the external environment and systems for consuming, processing and publishing events. It uses the following components to achieve its tasks: SiddhiManager : This is a key component of Siddhi Core that manages Siddhi Application Runtimes and facilitates their functionality via Siddhi Context with periodic state persistence, statistics reporting and extension loading. It is recommended to use one Siddhi Manager for a single JVM. SiddhiAppRuntime : Siddhi Application Runtime can be generated for each Siddhi Application through the Siddhi Manager. Siddhi Application Runtimes provide an isolated execution environment for each defined Siddhi Application. These Siddhi Application Runtimes can have their own lifecycle and they execute based on the logic defined in their Siddhi Application. SiddhiContext : This is a shared object across all the Siddhi Application Runtimes within the same Siddhi manager. It contains references to the persistence store for periodic persistence, statistics manager to report performance statistics of Siddhi Application Runtimes, and extension holders for loading Siddhi extensions. Siddhi Application Creation Execution logic of the Siddhi Engine is composed as a Siddhi Application, and this is usually passed as a string to SiddhiManager to create the SiddhiAppRuntime for execution. When a Siddhi Application is passed to the SiddhiManager.createSiddhiAppRuntime() , it is processed internally with the SiddhiCompiler . Here, the SiddhiApp String is compiled to SiddhiApp object model by the SiddhiQLBaseVisitorImpl class. This validates the syntax of the given Siddhi Application. The model is then passed to the SiddhiAppParser to create the SiddhiAppRuntime . During this phase, the semantics of the Siddhi Application is validated and the execution logic of the Siddhi Application is optimized. Siddhi App Execution Flow Following diagram depicts the execution flow within a Siddhi App Runtime. The path taken by events within Siddhi Engine is indicated in blue. The components that are involved in handling the events are the following: StreamJunction This routes events of a particular stream to various components within the Siddhi App Runtime. A stream junction is generated for each defined or inferred Stream in the Siddhi Application. A stream junction by default uses the incoming event's thread and passes all the events to its subscribed components as soon as they arrive, but this behaviour can be altered by configuring @Async annotation to buffer the events at the and stream junction and to use another one or more threads to collect the events from the buffer and process the subsequent executions. InputHandler Input handler is used to push Event and Event[] objects into stream junctions from defined event sources, and from Java/Python programmes. StreamCallback This receives Event[] s from stream junction and passes them to event sinks to publish to external endpoints, and/or passes them to subscribed Java/Python programmes for further processing. Queries Partitions These components process events by filtering, transforming, aggregating, joining, pattern matching, etc. They consume events from one or more stream junctions, process them and publish the processed events into a set of stream junctions based on the defined queries or partitions. Source Sources consume events from external sources in various data formats, convert them into Siddhi events using SourceMapper s and pass them to corresponding stream junction via their associated input handlers. A source is generated for each @Source annotation defined above a stream definition. SourceMapper A source mapper is a sub-component of source, and it needs to be configured for each source in order to convert the incoming event into Siddhi event. The source mapper type can be configured using the @Map annotation within the @Source annotation. When the @Map annotation is not defined, Siddhi uses the PassThroughSourceMapper , where it assumes that the incoming message is already in the Siddhi Event format (i.e Event or Event[] ), and therefore makes no changes to the incoming event format. Sink Sinks consumes events from its associated stream junction, convert them to various data formats via SinkMapper and publish them to external endpoints as defined in the @Sink annotation. A sink is generated for each @Sink annotation defined above a stream definition. SinkMapper A sink mapper is a sub-component of sink. and its need to be configured for each sink in order to map the Siddhi events to the specified data format so that they can be published via the sink. The sink mapper type can be configured using the @Map annotation within the @Sink annotation. When the @Map annotation is not defined, Siddhi uses PassThroughSinkMapper , where it passes the Siddhi Event (i.e Event or Event[] ) without any formatting to the Sink. Table Tables are used to store events. When tables are defined by default, Siddhi uses the InMemoryTable implementation to store events in-memory. When @Store annotation is used on top of the table definition, it loads the associated external data store connector based on the defined store type. Most table implementations are extended from either AbstractRecordTable or AbstractQueryableRecordTable abstract classes the former provides the functionality to query external data store based on a given filtering condition, and the latter queries external data store by providing projection, limits, and ordering parameters in addition to data filter condition. Window Windows store events as and when they arrive and automatically expire/clean them based on the given window constraint. Multiple types of windows are can be implemented by extending the WindowProcessor abstract class. IncrementalAggregation Long running time series aggregates defined via the aggregation definition is calculated in an incremental manner using the Incremental Aggregation Processor for the defined time periods. Incremental aggregation functions can be implemented by extending IncrementalAttributeAggregator . By default, incremental aggregations aggregate all the values in-memory, but when it is associated with a store by adding @store annotation it uses in-memory to aggregate partial results and uses data stores to persist those increments. When requested for aggregate results it retrieves data from data stores and (if needed from) in-memory, computes combined aggregate results and provides as the output. Trigger A trigger triggers events at a given interval as given in the trigger definition. The triggered events are pushed to a stream junction having the same name as the trigger. QueryCallback A query callback taps into the events that are emitted by a particular query. It notifies the event occurrence timestamp and classifies the output events into currentEvents , and expiredEvents . Siddhi Query Execution Siddhi QueryRuntimes can be categorized into three main types: SingleInputStream : Queries that consist of query types such as filters and windows. JoinInputStream : Queries that consist of joins. StateInputStream : Queries that consist of patterns and sequences. The following section explains the internals of each query type. SingleInputStream Query Runtime (Filter Windows) A single input stream query runtime is generated for filter and window queries. They consume events from a stream junction or a window and convert the incoming events according to the expected output stream format at the ProcessStreamReceiver by dropping all the unrelated incoming stream attributes. Then the converted events are passed through a few Processors such as FilterProcessor , StreamProcessor , StreamFunctionProcessor , WindowProcessor , and QuerySelector . Here, the StreamProcessor , StreamFunctionProcessor , and WindowProcessor can be extended with various stream processing capabilities. The last processor of the chain of processors must always be a QuerySelector and it can't appear anywhere else. When the query runtime consumes events from a stream, its processor chain can maximum contain one WindowProcessor , and when query runtime consumes events from a window, its chain of processors cannot contain any WindowProcessor . The FilterProcessor is implemented using expressions that return a boolean value. ExpressionExecutor is used to process conditions, mathematical operations, unary operations, constant values, variables, and functions. Expressions have a tree structure, and they are processed based using the Depth First search algorithm. To achieve high performance, Siddhi currently depends on the user to formulate the least successful case in the leftmost side of the condition, thereby increasing the chance of early false detection. The condition expression price = 100 and ( Symbol == 'IBM' or Symbol == 'MSFT' ) is represented as shown below. These expressions also support the execution of user-defined functions (UDFs), and they can be implemented by extending the FunctionExecutor class. After getting processed by all the processors, events reach the QuerySelector for transformation. At the QuerySelector , events are transformed based on the select clause of the query. The select clause produces one AttributeProcessor for each output stream attribute, and these AttributeProcessor s contain expressions defining data transformation including constant values, variables, user-defined functions, etc. They can also contain AttributeAggregatorExecutor s to process aggregation operations such as sum , count , etc. If there is a Group By clause defined, then the GroupByKeyGenerator is used to identify the composite group-by key, and then for each key, an AttributeAggregatorExecutor state is generated to maintain per group-by key aggregations. When each time AttributeProcessor is executed the AttributeAggregatorExecutor calculates per group-by aggregation results and output the values. When AttributeAggregatorExecutor group-by states become obsolete, they are destroyed and automatically cleaned. After an event is transformed to the output format through the above process, it is evaluated against the having condition executor if a having clause is provided. The succeeding events are then ordered, and limited based on order by , limit and offset clauses before they pushed to the OutputRateLimiter . At OutputRateLimiter , the event output is controlled before sending the events to the stream junction or to the query callback. When the output clause is not defined, the PassThroughOutputRateLimiter is used by passing all the events without any rate limiting. Temporal Processing with Windows The temporal event processing aspect is achieved via Window and AttributeAggregators To achieve temporal processing, Siddhi uses the following four type of events: Current Events : Events that are newly arriving to the query from streams. Expired Events : Events that have expired from a window. Timer Events : Events that inform the query about an update of execution time. These events are usually generated by schedulers. Reset Events : Events that resets the Siddhi query states. In Siddhi, when an event comes into a WindowProcessor , it creates an appropriate expired event corresponding to the incoming current event with the expiring timestamp, and stores that event in the window. At the same time, WindowProcessor also forwards the current event to the next processor for further processing. It uses a scheduler or some other counting approach to determine when to emit the events that are stored in in-memory. When the expired events meet the condition for expiry based on the window contains, it emits the expired events to the next processor. At times like in window.timeBatch() there can be cases that need emitting all the events in-memory at once and the output does not need individual expired events values, in this cases the window emits a single reset event instead of sending one expired event for each event it has stored, so that it can reset the states in one go. For the QuerySelector aggregations to work correctly the window must emit a corresponding expired event for each current event it has emitted or it must send a reset event . In the QuerySelector , the arrived current events increase the aggregation values, expired events decrease the values, and reset events reset the aggregation calculation to produce correct query output. For example, the sliding TimeWindow ( window.time() ) creates a corresponding expired event for each current event that arrives, adds the expired event s to the window, adds an entry to the scheduler to notify when that event need to be expired, and finally sends the current event to the next processor for subsequent processing. The scheduler notifies the window by sending a timer event , and when the window receives an indication that the expected expiry time has come for the oldest event in the window via a timer event or by other means, it removes the expired event from the window and passes that to the next processor. JoinInputStream Query Runtime (Join) Join input stream query runtime is generated for join queries. This can consume events from two stream junctions and perform a join operation as depicted above. It can also perform a join by consuming events from one stream junction and join against itself, or it can also join against a table, window or an aggregation. When a join is performed with a table, window or aggregation, the WindowProcessor in the above image is replaced with the corresponding table, window or aggregation and no basic processors are used on their side. The joining operation is triggered by the events that arrive from the stream junction. Here, when an event from one stream reaches the pre JoinProcessor , it matches against all the available events of the other stream's WindowProcessor . When a match is found, those matched events are sent to the QuerySelector as current events , and at the same time, the original event is added to the WindowProcessor where it remains until it expires. Similarly, when an event expires from the WindowProcessor , it matches against all the available events of the other stream's WindowProcessor , and when a match is found, those matched events are sent to the QuerySelector as expired events . Note Despite the optimizations, a join query is quite expensive when it comes to performance. This is because the WindowProcessor is locked during the matching process to avoid race conditions and to achieve accuracy while joining. Therefore, when possible avoid matching large (time or length) windows in high volume streams. StateInputStream Query Runtime (Pattern Sequence) The state input stream query runtime is generated for pattern and sequence queries. This consumes events from one or more stream junctions via ProcessStreamReceiver s and checks whether the events match each pattern or sequence condition by processing the set of basic processors associated with each ProcessStreamReceiver . The PreStateProcessor s usually contains lists of state events that are already matched by previous conditions, and if its the first condition then it will have an empty state event in its list. When ProcessStreamReceiver consumes an event, it passes the event to the PreStateProcessor which updates the list of state events it has with the incoming event and executes the condition by passing the events to the basic processors. The state events that match the conditions reach the PostStateProcessor which will then stores the events to the state event list of the following PreStateProcessor . If it is the final condition's PostStateProcessor , then it will pass the state event to the QuerySelector to generate and emit the output. Siddhi Partition Execution A partition is a wrapper around one or more Siddhi queries and inner streams that connect them. A partition is implemented in Siddhi as a PartitionRuntime which contains multiple QueryRuntime s and inner stream junctions. Each partitioned stream entering the partition goes through a designated PartitionStreamReceiver . The PartitionExecutor of PartitionStreamReceiver evaluates the incoming events to identify their associated partition-key using either RangePartitionExecutor or ValuePartitionExecutor . The identified partition-key is then set as thread local variable and the event is passed to the QueryRuntime s of processing. The QueryRuntime s process events by maintaining separate states for each partition-key such that producing separate output per partition. When a partition query consumes a non-partitioned global stream, the QueryRuntime s are executed for each available partition-key in the system such that allowing all partitions to receive the same event. When the partitions are obsolete PartitionRuntime deletes all the partition states from its QueryRuntime s. Siddhi Aggregation Siddhi supports long duration time series aggregations via its aggregation definition. AggregationRuntime implements this by the use of streaming lambda architecture , where it processes part of the data in-memory and gets part of the data from data stores. AggregationRuntime creates an in-memory table or external store for each time granularity (i.e seconds, minutes, days, etc) it has to process the events, and when events enter it calculates the aggregations in-memory for its least granularity (usually seconds) using the IncrementalExecutor and maintains the running aggregation values in its BaseIncrementalValueStore . At each clock end time of the granularity (end of each second) IncrementalExecutor stores the summarized values to the associated granularity table and also passes the summarized values to the IncrementalExecutor of the next granularity level, which also follows the same methodology in processing the events. Through this approach each time granularities, the current time duration will be in-memory and all the historical time durations will be in stored in the tables. The aggregations results are calculated by IncrementalAttributeAggregator s and stored in such a way that allows proper data composition upon retrial, for example, avg() is stored as sum and count . This allows data composition across various granularity time durations when retrieving, for example, results for avg() composed by returning sum of sum s divided by the sum of count s. Aggregation can also work in a distributed manner and across system restarts. This is done by storing node specific IDs and granularity time duration information in the tables. To make sure tables do not go out of memory IncrementalDataPurging is used to purge old data. When aggregation is queried through join or store query for a given time granularity it reads the data from the in-memory BaseIncrementalValueStore and from the tables computes the composite results as described, and presents the results. Siddhi Event Formats Siddhi has three event formats. Event This is the format exposed to external systems when they send events via Input Handler and consume events via Stream Callback or Query Callback. This consists of a timestamp and an Object[] that contains all the values in accordance to the corresponding stream. StreamEvent (Subtype of ComplexEvent ) This is used within queries. This contains a timestamp and the following three Object[] s: beforeWindowData : This contains values that are only used in processors that are executed before the WindowProcessor . onAfterWindowData : This contains values that are only used by the WindowProcessor and the other processors that follow it, but not sent as output. outputData : This contains the values that are sent via the output stream of the query. In order to optimize the amount of data that is stored in the in-memory at windows, the content in beforeWindowData is cleared before the event enters the WindowProcessor . StreamEvents can also be chained by linking each other via the next property in them. StateEvent (Subtype of ComplexEvent ) This is used in joins, patterns and sequences queries when we need to associate events of multiple streams, tables, windows or aggregations together. This contains a timestamp , a collection of StreamEvent s representing different streams, tables, etc, that are used in the query, and an Object[] to contain outputData values that are needed for query output. The StreamEvent s within the StateEvent and the StateEvent themselves can be chained by linking each other with the next property in them. Event Chunks Event Chunks provide an easier way of manipulating the chain of StreamEvent s and StateEvent s so that they are be easily iterated, inserted and removed.

The scheduler notifies the window by sending a timer event , and when the window receives an indication that the expected expiry time has come for the oldest event in the window via a timer event or by other means, it removes the expired event from the window and passes that to the next processor.","title":"Temporal Processing with Windows"},{"location":"documentation/siddhi-5.x/architecture-5.x/#joininputstream-query-runtime-join","text":"Join input stream query runtime is generated for join queries. This can consume events from two stream junctions and perform a join operation as depicted above. It can also perform a join by consuming events from one stream junction and join against itself, or it can also join against a table, window or an aggregation. When a join is performed with a table, window or aggregation, the WindowProcessor in the above image is replaced with the corresponding table, window or aggregation and no basic processors are used on their side. The joining operation is triggered by the events that arrive from the stream junction. Here, when an event from one stream reaches the pre JoinProcessor , it matches against all the available events of the other stream's WindowProcessor . When a match is found, those matched events are sent to the QuerySelector as current events , and at the same time, the original event is added to the WindowProcessor where it remains until it expires. Similarly, when an event expires from the WindowProcessor , it matches against all the available events of the other stream's WindowProcessor , and when a match is found, those matched events are sent to the QuerySelector as expired events . Note Despite the optimizations, a join query is quite expensive when it comes to performance. This is because the WindowProcessor is locked during the matching process to avoid race conditions and to achieve accuracy while joining.

When ProcessStreamReceiver consumes an event, it passes the event to the PreStateProcessor which updates the list of state events it has with the incoming event and executes the condition by passing the events to the basic processors.

AggregationRuntime implements this by the use of streaming lambda architecture , where it processes part of the data in-memory and gets part of the data from data stores. AggregationRuntime creates an in-memory table or external store for each time granularity (i.e seconds, minutes, days, etc) it has to process the events, and when events enter it calculates the aggregations in-memory for its least granularity (usually seconds) using the IncrementalExecutor and maintains the running aggregation values in its BaseIncrementalValueStore . At each clock end time of the granularity (end of each second) IncrementalExecutor stores the summarized values to the associated granularity table and also passes the summarized values to the IncrementalExecutor of the next granularity level, which also follows the same methodology in processing the events. Through this approach each time granularities, the current time duration will be in-memory and all the historical time durations will be in stored in the tables. The aggregations results are calculated by IncrementalAttributeAggregator s and stored in such a way that allows proper data composition upon retrial, for example, avg() is stored as sum and count . This allows data composition across various granularity time durations when retrieving, for example, results for avg() composed by returning sum of sum s divided by the sum of count s. Aggregation can also work in a distributed manner and across system restarts. This is done by storing node specific IDs and granularity time duration information in the tables. To make sure tables do not go out of memory IncrementalDataPurging is used to purge old data. When aggregation is queried through join or store query for a given time granularity it reads the data from the in-memory BaseIncrementalValueStore and from the tables computes the composite results as described, and presents the results.","title":"Siddhi Aggregation"},{"location":"documentation/siddhi-5.x/architecture-5.x/#siddhi-event-formats","text":"Siddhi has three event formats.

This contains a timestamp and the following three Object[] s: beforeWindowData : This contains values that are only used in processors that are executed before the WindowProcessor . onAfterWindowData : This contains values that are only used by the WindowProcessor and the other processors that follow it, but not sent as output. outputData : This contains the values that are sent via the output stream of the query.

Configuring Databases Configuring Periodic State Persistence Configuring Siddhi Sources, Sinks, Stores and Extensions Configuring Authentication Adding Extensions and Third Party Dependencies Configuring Statistics Converting Jars to OSGi Bundles Configuring Databases Applicable only for Local, Docker, and Kubernetes modes. This section is not applicable for Java and Python modes. It is recommended to configure RDBMS databases as datasources under wso2.datasources section of Siddhi configuration yaml, and pass it during startup, this will allow database to reuse connections across multiple Siddhi Apps. By default Siddhi stores product-specific data in predefined embedded H2 database located in SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME /wso2/runner/database directory. Here, the default H2 database is only suitable for development, testing, and some production environments which do not store data. However, for most production environments we recommend using industry-standard RDBMS such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MSSQL. In this case users are expected to add the relevant database drivers to Siddhi's class-path. Including database drivers. The database driver corresponding to the database should be an OSGi bundle and it need to be added to SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME /lib/ directory. If the driver is a jar then this should be converted to an OSGi bundle before adding . Converting Non OSGi drivers. If the database driver is not an OSGi bundle, then it should be converted to OSGi. Please refer Converting Jars to OSGi Bundles documentation for details. The necessary table schemas are self generated by the features themselves, other than the tables needed for statistics reporting via databases . Below are the sample datasource configuration for each supported database types: MySQL Oracle There are two ways to configure Oracle. If you have a System Identifier (SID), use this (older) format: jdbc:oracle:thin:@[HOST][:PORT]:SID If you have an Oracle service name, use this (newer) format: jdbc:oracle:thin:@//[HOST][:PORT]/SERVICE PostgreSQL MSSQL Configuring Periodic State Persistence Applicable only for Local, Docker, and Kubernetes modes. This section is not applicable for Java and Python modes. This explains how to periodically persisting the state of Siddhi either into a database system or file system, in order to prevent data losses that can result from a system failure. Persistence on Database To perform periodic state persistence on a database, the database should be configured as a datasource and the relevant jdbc drivers should be added to Siddhi's class-path. Refer Database Configuration section for more information. To configure database based periodic data persistence, add state.persistence section with the following properties on the Siddhi configuration yaml, and pass that during startup. Parameter Purpose Required Value enabled This enables data persistence. true intervalInMin The time interval in minutes that defines the interval in which state of Siddhi applications should be persisted 1 revisionsToKeep The number of revisions to keep in the system. Here when a new persistence takes place, the older revisions are removed. 3 persistenceStore The persistence store io.siddhi.distribution.core.persistence.DBPersistenceStore config datasource The datasource to be used in persisting the state. The datasource should be defined in the Siddhi configuration yaml. For detailed instructions of how to configure a datasource, see Database Configuration . SIDDHI_PERSISTENCE_DB (A datasource that is defined in wso2.datasources in Siddhi configuration yaml) config table The table that should be created and used for persisting states. PERSISTENCE_TABLE The following is a sample configuration for database based state persistence. Persistence on File System To configure file system based periodic data persistence, add state.persistence section with the following properties on the Siddhi configuration yaml, and pass that during startup. Parameter Purpose Required Value enabled This enables data persistence. true intervalInMin The time interval in minutes that defines the interval in which state of Siddhi applications should be persisted 1 revisionsToKeep The number of revisions to keep in the system.

Configuring Siddhi Elements Applicable only for Local, Docker, and Kubernetes modes. This section is not applicable for Java and Python modes. You can configure some of there environment specific configurations in the Siddhi Configuration yaml rather than configuring in-line, such that your Siddhi Application can become potable between environments. Configuring Sources, Sinks and Stores Multiple sources, sinks, and stores could be defined in Siddhi Configuration yaml as ref , and referred by several Siddhi Applications as described below. The following is the syntax for the configuration. siddhi: refs: - ref: name: name type: type properties: property1 : value1 property2 : value2 For each separate refs you want to configure, add a sub-section named ref under the refs subsection. The ref configured in Siddhi Configuration yaml can be referred from a Siddhi Application Source as follows. @Source(ref= name , @map(type= json , @attributes( name= $.name , amount= $.quantity ))) define stream SweetProductionStream (name string, amount double); Similarly Sinks and Store Tables can also be configured and referred from Siddhi Apps. For each separate refs you want to configure, add a sub-section named ref under the refs subsection. Example : Configuring http source using ref Following configuration defines the url and details about basic.auth , in the Siddhi Configuration yaml. siddhi: refs: - ref: name: http-passthrough type: http properties: receiver.url: http://0.0.0.0:8008/sweet-production basic.auth.enabled: false This can be referred in the Siddhi Applications as follows. @Source(ref= http-passthrough , @map(type= json , @attributes( name= $.name , amount= $.quantity ))) define stream SweetProductionStream (name string, amount double); Configuring Extensions Siddhi extensions cater use-case specific logic that is not available by default in Siddhi. Some of these extensions have system parameter configurations to define/modify their behavior. These extensions usually have default values for the parameters, but when needed, they can be overridden by configuring the parameters in Siddhi Configuration yaml and passing it at startup. The following is the syntax for the configuration. siddhi: extensions: - extension: name: extension name namespace: extension namespace properties: key : value For each separate extension you want to configure, add a sub-section named extension under the extensions subsection. Following are some examples on overriding default system properties via Siddhi Configuration yaml Example 1 : Defining service host and port for the TCP source siddhi: extensions: - extension: name: tcp namespace: source properties: host: 0.0.0.0 port: 5511 Example 2 : Overwriting the default RDBMS extension configuration siddhi: extensions: - extension: name: rdbms namespace: store properties: mysql.batchEnable: true mysql.batchSize: 1000 mysql.indexCreateQuery: CREATE INDEX {{TABLE_NAME}}_INDEX ON {{TABLE_NAME}} ({{INDEX_COLUMNS}}) mysql.recordDeleteQuery: DELETE FROM {{TABLE_NAME}} {{CONDITION}} mysql.recordExistsQuery: SELECT 1 FROM {{TABLE_NAME}} {{CONDITION}} LIMIT 1 Configuring Authentication Applicable only for Local, Docker, and Kubernetes modes. This section is not applicable for Java and Python modes. By default, Siddhi is configured with user name admin , and password admin . This can be updated by adding related user management configuration as auth.configs to the Siddhi Configuration yaml, and pass it at startup. A sample auth.configs is as follows. # Authentication configuration auth.configs: type: local # Type of the IdP client used userManager: adminRole: admin # Admin role which is granted all permissions userStore: # User store users: - user: username: admin password: YWRtaW4= roles: 1 roles: - role: id: 1 displayName: admin Adding Extensions and Third Party Dependencies Applicable for all modes. For certain use-cases, Siddhi might require extensions and/or third party dependencies to fulfill some characteristics that it does not provide by default. This section provides details on how to add or update extension and/or third party dependencies that is needed by Siddhi. Adding to Siddhi Java Program When running Siddhi as a Java library, the extension jars and/or third-party dependencies needed for Siddhi can be simply added to Siddhi class-path. When Maven is used as the build tool add them to the pom.xml file along with the other mandatory jars needed by Siddhi as given is Using Siddhi as a library guide. A sample on adding siddhi-io-http extension to the Maven pom.xml is as follows. !--HTTP extension-- dependency groupId org.wso2.extension.siddhi.io.http /groupId artifactId siddhi-io-http /artifactId version ${siddhi.io.http.version} /version /dependency Refer guide for more details on using Siddhi as a Java Library. Adding to Siddhi Local Microservice The most used Siddhi extensions are packed by default with the Siddhi Local Microservice distribution. To add or update Siddhi extensions and/or third-party dependencies, adding or replacing the relevant OSGi JARs in SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME /lib directory. Since Local Microservice is OSGi-based, when adding libraries/drivers they need to be checked if they are OSGi bundles, and if not convert to OSGi before adding them to the SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME /lib directory. Converting Jars to OSGi Bundles.. If the database driver is not an OSGi bundle, then it should be converted to OSGi. Please refer Converting Jars to OSGi Bundles documentation for details. Refer guide for more details on using Siddhi as Local Microservice. Adding to Siddhi Docker Microservice The most used Siddhi extensions are packed by default with the Siddhi Docker Microservice distribution. To add or update Siddhi extensions and/or third-party dependencies, a new docker image has to be built from either siddhi-runner-base-ubuntu or siddhi-runner-base-alpine images. These images contain Linux OS, JDK and the Siddhi distribution. Sample docker file using siddhi-runner-base-alpine is as follows. Find the necessary artifacts to build the docker from docker-siddhi repository. The necessary OSGi jars and extensions that need to be added to the Siddhi Docker Microservice should be placed at ${BUNDLE_JAR_DIR} ( ./files/lib ) folder as defined in the above docker file, such that they would be bundled during the docker build phase. Converting Jars to OSGi Bundles If the database driver is not an OSGi bundle, then it should be converted to OSGi. Please refer Converting Jars to OSGi Bundles documentation for details. Refer guide for more details on using Siddhi as Docker Microservice. Adding to Siddhi Kubernetes Microservice To add or update Siddhi extensions and/or third-party dependencies, a custom docker image has to be created using the steps described in Adding to Siddhi Docker Microservice documentation including the necessary extensions and dependencies. The created image can be then referenced in the sepc.pod subsection in the SiddhiProcess Kubernetes artifact created to deploy Siddhi in Kubernetes. For details on creating the Kubernetes artifacts refer Using Siddhi as Kubernetes Microservice documentation. Configuring Statistics Applicable only for Local, Docker, and Kubernetes modes. This section is not applicable for Java and Python modes. Siddhi uses dropwizard metrics library to calculate Siddhi and JVM statistics, and it can report the results via JMX Mbeans, console or database. To enable statistics, the relevant configuration should be added to the Siddhi Configuration yaml as follows, and at the same time the statistics collection should be enabled in the Siddhi Application which is being monitored. Refer Siddhi Application Statistics documentation for enabling Siddhi Application level statistics. To enable statistics the relevant matrics related configurations should be added under wso2.metrics section in the Siddhi Configurations yaml file, and pass that during startup. Configuring Metrics reporting level. To modify the statistics reporting, relevant metric names can be added under the wso2.metrics.levels subsection in the Siddhi Configurations yaml, along with the matrics level (i.e., OFF, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE, or ALL) as given bellow. wso2.metrics: # Metrics Levels are organized from most specific to least: # OFF (most specific, no metrics) # INFO # DEBUG # TRACE (least specific, a lot of data) # ALL (least specific, all data) levels: # The root level configured for Metrics rootLevel: INFO # Metric Levels levels: jvm.buffers: 'OFF' jvm.class-loading: INFO jvm.gc: DEBUG jvm.memory: INFO The available metrics reporting options are as follows. Reporting via JMX Mbeans JMX Mbeams is the default statistics reporting option of Siddhi. To enable stats with the default configuration add the metric-related properties under wso2.metrics section in the Siddhi Configurations yaml file, and pass that during startup. A sample configuration is as follows. wso2.metrics: enabled: true This will report JMX Mbeans in the name of org.wso2.carbon.metrics . However, in this default configuration the JVM metrics will not be measured. A detail JMX configuration along with the metrics reporting level is as follows. wso2.metrics: # Enable Metrics enabled: true jmx: # Register MBean when initializing Metrics registerMBean: true # MBean Name name: org.wso2.carbon:type=Metrics # Metrics Levels are organized from most specific to least: # OFF (most specific, no metrics) # INFO # DEBUG # TRACE (least specific, a lot of data) # ALL (least specific, all data) levels: # The root level configured for Metrics rootLevel: INFO # Metric Levels levels: jvm.buffers: OFF jvm.class-loading: INFO jvm.gc: DEBUG jvm.memory: INFO Reporting via Console To enable statistics by periodically printing the metrics on console add the following configuration to the the Siddhi Configurations yaml file, and pass that during startup. # This is the main configuration for metrics wso2.metrics: # Enable Metrics enabled: false reporting: console: - # The name for the Console Reporter name: Console # Enable Console Reporter enabled: false # Polling Period in seconds. # This is the period for polling metrics from the metric registry and printing in the console pollingPeriod: 5 Reporting via Database To enable JDBC reporting and to periodically clean up the outdated statistics from the database, first a datasource should be created with the relevant database configurations and then the related metrics properties as given bellow should be added to in the Siddhi Configurations yaml file, and pass that during startup. The bellow sample is referring to the datasource with JNDI name jdbc/SiddhiMetricsDB , hence the datasource configuration in yaml should have jndiConfig.name as jdbc/SiddhiMetricsDB . For detailed instructions on configuring a datasource, refer Configuring Databases . . The scripts to create these tables are provided in the SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME /wso2/runner/dbscripts directory. Sample configuration of reporting via database. wso2.metrics: # Enable Metrics enabled: true jdbc: # Data Source Configurations for JDBC Reporters dataSource: # Default Data Source Configuration - JDBC01 # JNDI name of the data source to be used by the JDBC Reporter. # This data source should be defined under wso2.datasources. dataSourceName: java:comp/env/jdbc/SiddhiMetricsDB # Schedule regular deletion of metrics data older than a set number of days. # It is recommended that you enable this job to ensure your metrics tables do not get extremely large. # Deleting data older than seven days should be sufficient. scheduledCleanup: # Enable scheduled cleanup to delete Metrics data in the database. enabled: false # The scheduled job will cleanup all data older than the specified days daysToKeep: 7 # This is the period for each cleanup operation in seconds. scheduledCleanupPeriod: 86400 reporting: jdbc: - # The name for the JDBC Reporter name: JDBC # Enable JDBC Reporter enabled: true # Source of Metrics, which will be used to identify each metric in database -- # Commented to use the hostname by default # source: Siddhi # Alias referring to the Data Source configuration dataSource: *JDBC01 # Polling Period in seconds. # This is the period for polling metrics from the metric registry and updating the database with the values pollingPeriod: 60 Metrics history and reporting interval If the wso2.metrics.reporting.jdbc subsection is not enabled, the information relating to metrics history will not be persisted for future references. Also note the that the reporting will only start to update the database after the given pollingPeriod time has elapsed. Information about the parameters configured under the jdbc.dataSource subsection in the Siddhi Configuration yaml is as follows. Parameter Default Value Description dataSourceName java:comp/env/jdbc/SiddhiMetricsDB java:comp/env/ datasource JNDI name . The JNDI name of the datasource used to store metric data. scheduledCleanup.enabled false If this is set to true, metrics data stored in the database is cleared periodically based on scheduled time interval. scheduledCleanup.daysToKeep 3 If scheduled clean-up of metric data is enabled, all metric data in the database that are older than the number of days specified in this parameter are deleted. scheduledCleanup.scheduledCleanupPeriod 86400 The parameter specifies the time interval in seconds at which metric data should be cleaned. Converting Jars to OSGi Bundles To convert jar files to OSGi bundles, first download and save the non-OSGi jar it in a preferred directory in your machine. Then from the CLI, navigate to the SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME /bin directory, and issue the following command. ./jartobundle.sh path to non OSGi jar ../lib This converts the Jar to OSGi bundles and place it in SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME /lib directory.","title":"Config Guide"},{"location":"documentation/siddhi-5.x/config-guide-5.x/#siddhi-5x-config-guide","text":"This section covers the following.

It's highly optimized for performance and performs stream processing, complex event processing, streaming data integration, and adaptive intelligence for mission-critical systems. Siddhi is used by many companies including Uber, eBay, PayPal (via Apache Eagle), here Uber processed more than 20 billion events per day using Siddhi for their fraud analytics use cases. Siddhi is also used in various analytics and integration platforms such as Apache Eagle as a policy enforcement engine, WSO2 API Manager as analytics and throttling engine, WSO2 Identity Server as an adaptive authorization engine. This quick start guide contains the following six sections: Domain of Siddhi Overview of Siddhi architecture Using Siddhi for the first time Siddhi \u2018Hello World!\u2019 Testing Siddhi Application A bit of Stream Processing 1. Domain of Siddhi Siddhi is an event driven system where all the data it consumes, processes and sends are modeled as events. Therefore Siddhi can play a vital part in any system built using event-driven architecture. As Siddhi works with events first let's understand what an event is through an example. If we consider the transactions carried out via an ATM as a data stream, one withdrawal from it can be considered an event . This event contains data about the amount, time, account number etc. Many such transactions form a stream. Siddhi provides following functionalities, Streaming data analytics Forrester defines Streaming Analytics as: Software that provides analytical operators to orchestrate data flow , calculate analytics , and detect patterns on event data from multiple, disparate live data sources to allow developers to build applications that sense, think, and act in real time . Complex Event Processing (CEP) Gartner\u2019s IT Glossary defines CEP as follows: \"CEP is a kind of computing in which incoming data about events is distilled into more useful, higher level \u201ccomplex\u201devent data that provides insight into what is happening.\" \" CEP is event-driven because the computation is triggered by the receipt of event data. CEP is used for highly demanding, continuous-intelligence applications that enhance situation awareness and support real-time decisions.\" Streaming data integration Streaming data integration is way of integrating several systems by continuously moving data in realtime from one system to another, while processing, correlating, and analyzing the data in-memory. Adaptive Intelligence Decision Engine Basically, Siddhi receives data event-by-event and processes them in real time to produce meaningful information. Using the above Siddhi can be used to solve may use-cases as follows: Fraud Analytics Monitoring Anomaly Detection Sentiment Analysis Processing Customer Behavior .. etc 2. Overview of Siddhi architecture As indicated above, Siddhi can: Accept event inputs from many different types of sources Process them to generate insights Publish them to many types of sinks. To use Siddhi, you need to write the processing logic as a Siddhi Application in the Siddhi Streaming SQL language which is discussed in the section 4 . When the Siddhi application is started, it: Consumes data one-by-one as events Processes the data in each event Generates new high level events based on the processing done so far Sends newly generated events as the output to streams. 3. Using Siddhi for the first time In this section, we will be using the Tooling distribution\u200a\u2014\u200aa server version of Siddhi that has a sophisticated editor with a GUI(referred to as \u201cSiddhi Editor\u201d ) where you can write your query and simulate events as a data stream. Step 1 \u200a\u2014\u200aInstall Oracle Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 1.8. Step 2 \u200a\u2014\u200a Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable. Step 3 \u200a\u2014\u200aDownload the latest tooling distribution from here . Step 4 \u200a\u2014\u200aExtract the downloaded zip and navigate to TOOLING_HOME /bin . ( TOOLING_HOME refers to the extracted folder) Step 5 \u200a\u2014\u200aIssue the following command in the command prompt (Windows) / terminal (Linux) For Windows: tooling.bat For Linux: ./tooling.sh After successfully starting the Siddhi Editor, the terminal should look like as shown below: After starting the Siddhi Editor, access the Editor GUI by visiting the following link in your browser. http://localhost:9390/editor This takes you to the Siddhi Editor landing page. 4. Siddhi \u2018Hello World!\u2019 Siddhi Streaming SQL is a rich, compact, easy-to-learn SQL-like language. Let's first learn how to find the total of values coming into a data stream and output the current running total value with each event. Siddhi has lot of in-built functions and extensions available for complex analysis, but to get started, let's use a simple one. You can find more information about the Siddhi grammar and its functions in the Siddhi Query Guide . Let's consider a scenario where we are loading cargo boxes into a ship . We need to keep track of the total weight of the cargo added. Measuring the weight of a cargo box when loading is considered an event . We can write a Siddhi program for the above scenario which has 4 parts . Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aGiving our Siddhi application a suitable name. This is a Siddhi routine. In this example, let's name our application as \u201cHelloWorldApp\u201d @App:name( HelloWorldApp ) Part 2\u200a\u2014\u200aDefining the input stream. The stream needs to have a name and a schema defining the data that each incoming event should contain. The event data attributes are expressed as name and type pairs. Also we need to attach a_\"source\"_ to the created stream so that we can send events to that stream. ( Source is the Siddhi way to consume streams from external systems. This particular http type source will spin up a HTTP endpoint and keep on listening to events though that endpoint. To learn more about sources, see source ) In this example: The name of the input stream\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cCargoStream\u201d This contains only one data attribute: The name of the data in each event\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cweight\u201d Type of the data \u201cweight\u201d \u200a\u2014\u200aint Type of source - HTTP HTTP endpoint address - http://0.0.0.0:8006/cargo Accepted input data type - JSON @source(type = http , receiver.url = http://0.0.0.0:8006/cargo ,@map(type = json )) define stream CargoStream (weight int); Part 3 - Defining the output stream. This has the same info as the previous definition with an additional totalWeight attribute that contains the total weight calculated so far. Here, we need to add a \"sink\" to log the OutputStream so that we can observe the output values. ( Sink is the Siddhi way to publish streams to external systems. This particular log type sink just logs the stream events. To learn more about sinks, see sink ) @sink(type= log , prefix= LOGGER ) define stream OutputStream(weight int, totalWeight long); Part 4\u200a\u2014\u200aThe actual Siddhi query. Here we need to specify the following: A name for the query\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cHelloWorldQuery\u201d Which stream should be taken into processing\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cCargoStream\u201d What data we require in the output stream\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cweight\u201d , \u201ctotalWeight\u201d How the output should be calculated - by calculating the sum of the the weight s Which stream should be populated with the output\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cOutputStream\u201d @info(name= HelloWorldQuery ) from CargoStream select weight, sum(weight) as totalWeight insert into OutputStream; Final Siddhi application in the editor will look like below. You can copy the final Siddhi app from below. 5. Testing Siddhi Application In this section we will be testing the logical accuracy of Siddhi query using in-built functions of Siddhi Editor. In a later section we will invoke the HTTP endpoint and perform an end to end integration test. The Siddhi Editor has in-built support to simulate events. You can do it via the \u201cEvent Simulator\u201d panel at the left of the Siddhi Editor. You should save your HelloWorldApp by browsing to File - Save before you run event simulation. Then click Event Simulator and configure it as shown below. Step 1\u200a\u2014\u200aConfigurations: Siddhi App Name\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cHelloWorldApp\u201d Stream Name\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cCargoStream\u201d Timestamp\u200a\u2014\u200a(Leave it blank) weight\u200a\u2014\u200a2 (or some integer) Step 2\u200a\u2014\u200aClick \u201cRun\u201d mode and then click \u201cStart\u201d . This starts the Siddhi Application. If the Siddhi application is successfully started, the following message is printed in the Stream Processor Studio console: \u201cHelloWorldApp.siddhi Started Successfully!\u201d Step 3\u200a\u2014\u200aClick \u201cSend\u201d and observe the terminal You can see a log that contains \u201coutputData=[2, 2]\u201d . Click Send again and observe a log with \u201coutputData=[2, 4]\u201d . You can change the value of the weight and send it to see how the sum of the weight is updated. Bravo! You have successfully completed creating Siddhi Hello World! 6. A bit of Stream Processing This section will improve our Siddhi app to demonstrates how to carry out temporal window processing with Siddhi. Up to this point, we have been carrying out the processing by having only the running sum value in-memory. No events were stored during this process. Window processing is a method that allows us to store some events in-memory for a given period so that we can perform operations such as calculating the average, maximum, etc values within them. Let's imagine that when we are loading cargo boxes into the ship we need to keep track of the average weight of the recently loaded boxes so that we can balance the weight across the ship. For this purpose, let's try to find the average weight of last three boxes of each event. For window processing, we need to modify our query as follows: @info(name= HelloWorldQuery ) from CargoStream#window.length(3) select weight, sum(weight) as totalWeight, avg(weight) as averageWeight insert into OutputStream; from CargoStream#window.length(3) - Here, we are specifying that the last 3 events should be kept in memory for processing. avg(weight) as averageWeight - Here, we are calculating the average of events stored in the window and producing the average value as \"averageWeight\" (Note: Now the sum also calculates the totalWeight based on the last three events). We also need to modify the \"OutputStream\" definition to accommodate the new \"averageWeight\" . define stream OutputStream(weight int, totalWeight long, averageWeight double); The updated Siddhi Application is given below: Now you can send events using the Event Simulator and observe the log to see the sum and average of the weights of the last three cargo events. It is also notable that the defined length window only keeps 3 events in-memory. When the 4th event arrives, the first event in the window is removed from memory. This ensures that the memory usage does not grow beyond a specific limit. There are also other implementations done in Siddhi to reduce the memory consumption. For more information, see Siddhi Architecture . 7. Running streaming application as a microservice This step we will run above developed Siddhi application as a microservice utilizing Docker. For other available options please refer here . Here we will use siddhi-runner docker distribution. Follow below steps. Install docker in your machine and start the daemon.( https://docs.docker.com/install/ ) Pull the latest siddhi-runner image by executing below command docker pull siddhiio/siddhi-runner-alpine:latest Navigate to Siddhi Editor and choose File - Export File for download above Siddhi application as a file. Move downloaded Siddhi file( HelloWorldModifiedApp.siddhi ) to a desired location(/home/me/siddhi-apps) Execute below command to start a streaming microservice which runs above developed siddhi application. (Please pay attention to the siddhi app name as in the Quick Start Guide we have changed the modified Siddhi app name from that of the original app.) docker run -it -p 8006:8006 -v /home/me/siddhi-apps:/apps siddhiio/siddhi-runner-alpine -Dapps=/apps/HelloWorldModifiedApp.siddhi Once container is started use below curl command to send events into \"CargoStream\" curl -X POST http://localhost:8006/cargo \\ --header Content-Type:application/json \\ -d { event :{ weight :2}} You will observe below messages in container logs.

Testing Siddhi Application"},{"location":"documentation/siddhi-5.x/quckstart-5.x/#6-a-bit-of-stream-processing","text":"This section will improve our Siddhi app to demonstrates how to carry out temporal window processing with Siddhi. Up to this point, we have been carrying out the processing by having only the running sum value in-memory. No events were stored during this process. Window processing is a method that allows us to store some events in-memory for a given period so that we can perform operations such as calculating the average, maximum, etc values within them. Let's imagine that when we are loading cargo boxes into the ship we need to keep track of the average weight of the recently loaded boxes so that we can balance the weight across the ship. For this purpose, let's try to find the average weight of last three boxes of each event. For window processing, we need to modify our query as follows: @info(name= HelloWorldQuery ) from CargoStream#window.length(3) select weight, sum(weight) as totalWeight, avg(weight) as averageWeight insert into OutputStream; from CargoStream#window.length(3) - Here, we are specifying that the last 3 events should be kept in memory for processing. avg(weight) as averageWeight - Here, we are calculating the average of events stored in the window and producing the average value as \"averageWeight\" (Note: Now the sum also calculates the totalWeight based on the last three events). We also need to modify the \"OutputStream\" definition to accommodate the new \"averageWeight\" . define stream OutputStream(weight int, totalWeight long, averageWeight double); The updated Siddhi Application is given below: Now you can send events using the Event Simulator and observe the log to see the sum and average of the weights of the last three cargo events. It is also notable that the defined length window only keeps 3 events in-memory. When the 4th event arrives, the first event in the window is removed from memory. This ensures that the memory usage does not grow beyond a specific limit. There are also other implementations done in Siddhi to reduce the memory consumption.

Running streaming application as a microservice"},{"location":"documentation/siddhi-5.x/query-guide-5.x/","text":"Siddhi 5.x Streaming SQL Guide Info Please find the Siddhi 4.x Streaming SQL Guide here Introduction Siddhi Streaming SQL is designed to process streams of events. It can be used to implement streaming data integration, streaming analytics, rule based and adaptive decision making use cases. It is an evolution of Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Stream Processing systems, hence it can also be used to process stateful computations, detecting of complex event patterns, and sending notifications in real-time. Siddhi Streaming SQL uses SQL like syntax, and annotations to consume events from diverse event sources with various data formats, process then using stateful and stateless operators and send outputs to multiple endpoints according to their accepted event formats. It also supports exposing rule based and adaptive decision making as service endpoints such that external programs and systems can synchronously get decision support form Siddhi. The following sections explains how to write processing logic using Siddhi Streaming SQL. Siddhi Application The processing logic for your program can be written using the Streaming SQL and put together as a single file with .siddhi extension. This file is called as the Siddhi Application or the SiddhiApp . SiddhiApps are named by adding @app:name(' name ') annotation on the top of the SiddhiApp file. When the annotation is not added Siddhi assigns a random UUID as the name of the SiddhiApp. Purpose SiddhiApp provides an isolated execution environment for your processing logic that allows you to deploy and execute processing logic independent of other SiddhiApp in the system. Therefore it's always recommended to have a processing logic related to single use case in a single SiddhiApp. This will help you to group processing logic and easily manage addition and removal of various use cases. The following diagram depicts some of the key Siddhi Streaming SQL elements of Siddhi Application and how event flows through the elements. Below table provides brief description of a few key elements in the Siddhi Streaming SQL Language. Elements Description Stream A logical series of events ordered in time with a uniquely identifiable name, and a defined set of typed attributes defining its schema. Event An event is a single event object associated with a stream. All events of a stream contains a timestamp and an identical set of typed attributes based on the schema of the stream they belong to. Table A structured representation of data stored with a defined schema. Stored data can be backed by In-Memory , or external data stores such as RDBMS , MongoDB , etc. The tables can be accessed and manipulated at runtime. Named Window A structured representation of data stored with a defined schema and eviction policy. Window data is stored In-Memory and automatically cleared by the named window constrain. Other siddhi elements can only query the values in windows at runtime but they cannot modify them. Named Aggregation A structured representation of data that's incrementally aggregated and stored with a defined schema and aggregation granularity such as seconds, minutes, hours, etc. Aggregation data is stored both In-Memory and in external data stores such as RDBMS . Other siddhi elements can only query the values in windows at runtime but they cannot modify them. Query A logical construct that processes events in streaming manner by by consuming data from one or more streams, tables, windows and aggregations, and publishes output events into a stream, table or a window. Source A construct that consumes data from external sources (such as TCP , Kafka , HTTP , etc) with various event formats such as XML , JSON , binary , etc, convert then to Siddhi events, and passes into streams for processing. Sink A construct that consumes events arriving at a stream, maps them to a predefined data format (such as XML , JSON , binary , etc), and publishes them to external endpoints (such as E-mail , TCP , Kafka , HTTP , etc). Input Handler A mechanism to programmatically inject events into streams. Stream/Query Callback A mechanism to programmatically consume output events from streams or queries. Partition A logical container that isolates the processing of queries based on the partition keys derived from the events. Inner Stream A positionable stream that connects portioned queries with each other within the partition. Grammar SiddhiApp is a collection of Siddhi Streaming SQL elements composed together as a script. Here each Siddhi element must be separated by a semicolon ; . Hight level syntax of SiddhiApp is as follows. siddhi app : app annotation * ( stream definition | table definition | ... ) + ( query | partition ) + ; Example Siddhi Application with name Temperature-Analytics defined with a stream named TempStream and a query named 5minAvgQuery . @ app : name ( Temperature-Analytics ) define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); @ name ( 5minAvgQuery ) from TempStream # window . time ( 5 min ) select roomNo , avg ( temp ) as avgTemp group by roomNo insert into OutputStream ; Stream A stream is a logical series of events ordered in time. Its schema is defined via the stream definition . A stream definition contains the stream name and a set of attributes with specific types and uniquely identifiable names within the stream. All events associated to the stream will have the same schema (i.e., have the same attributes in the same order). Purpose Stream groups common types of events together with a schema. This helps in various ways such as, processing all events together in queries and performing data format transformations together when they are consumed and published via sources and sinks. Syntax The syntax for defining a new stream is as follows. define stream stream name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The following parameters are used to configure a stream definition. Parameter Description stream name The name of the stream created. (It is recommended to define a stream name in PascalCase .) attribute name Uniquely identifiable name of the stream attribute. (It is recommended to define attribute names in camelCase .) attribute type The type of each attribute defined in the schema. This can be STRING , INT , LONG , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL or OBJECT . To use and refer stream and attribute names that do not follow [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]* format enclose them in ` . E.g. `$test(0)` . To make the stream process events in multi-threading and asynchronous way use the @Async annotation as shown in Multi-threading and Asynchronous Processing configuration section. Example define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); The above creates a stream with name TempStream having the following attributes. deviceID of type long roomNo of type int temp of type double Source Sources receive events via multiple transports and in various data formats, and direct them into streams for processing. A source configuration allows to define a mapping in order to convert each incoming event from its native data format to a Siddhi event. When customizations to such mappings are not provided, Siddhi assumes that the arriving event adheres to the predefined format based on the stream definition and the configured message mapping type. Purpose Source provides a way to consume events from external systems and convert them to be processed by the associated stream. Syntax To configure a stream that consumes events via a source, add the source configuration to a stream definition by adding the @source annotation with the required parameter values. The source syntax is as follows: @ source ( type = source type , static . key = value , static . key = value , @ map ( type = map type , static . key = value , static . key = value , @ attributes ( attribute1 = attribute mapping , attributeN = attribute mapping ) ) ) define stream stream name ( attribute1 type , attributeN type ); This syntax includes the following annotations. Source The type parameter of @source annotation defines the source type that receives events. The other parameters of @source annotation depends upon the selected source type, and here some of its parameters can be optional. For detailed information about the supported parameters see the documentation of the relevant source. The following is the list of source types supported by Siddhi: Source type Description In-memory Allow SiddhiApp to consume events from other SiddhiApps running on the same JVM. HTTP Expose an HTTP service to consume messages. Kafka Subscribe to Kafka topic to consume events. TCP Expose a TCP service to consume messages. WSO2Event Expose a Thrift and TCP services to consume events formatted as WSO2Events. Email Consume emails via POP3 and IMAP protocols. JMS Subscribe to JMS topic or queue to consume events. File Reads files by tailing or as a whole to extract events out of them. RabbitMQ Subscribe to RabbitMQ topic to consume events. MQTT Subscribe to MQTT brokers to consume events. WebSocket Create a web-socket connection or expose a service to consume messages. Twitter Subscribe to Twitter to consume tweets. Amazon SQS Subscribe to Amazon SQS to consume events. CDC Perform change data capture on databases. Prometheus Consume data from Prometheus agent. In-memory is the only source inbuilt in Siddhi, and all other source types are implemented as extensions. Source Mapper Each @source configuration can have a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that defines how to convert the incoming event format to Siddhi events. The type parameter of the @map defines the map type to be used in converting the incoming events. The other parameters of @map annotation depends on the mapper selected, and some of its parameters can be optional. For detailed information about the parameters see the documentation of the relevant mapper. Map Attributes @attributes is an optional annotation used with @map to define custom mapping. When @attributes is not provided, each mapper assumes that the incoming events adheres to its own default message format and attempt to convert the events from that format. By adding the @attributes annotation, users can selectively extract data from the incoming message and assign them to the attributes. There are two ways to configure @attributes . Define attribute names as keys, and mapping configurations as values: @attributes( attribute1 =' mapping ', attributeN =' mapping ') Define the mapping configurations in the same order as the attributes defined in stream definition: @attributes( ' mapping for attribute1 ', ' mapping for attributeN ') Supported Source Mapping Types The following is the list of source mapping types supported by Siddhi: Source mapping type Description PassThrough Omits data conversion on Siddhi events. JSON Converts JSON messages to Siddhi events. XML Converts XML messages to Siddhi events. TEXT Converts plain text messages to Siddhi events. Avro Converts Avro events to Siddhi events. WSO2Event Converts WSO2Events to Siddhi events. Binary Converts Siddhi specific binary events to Siddhi events. Key Value Converts key-value HashMaps to Siddhi events. CSV Converts CSV like delimiter separated events to Siddhi events. Tip When the @map annotation is not provided @map(type='passThrough') is used as default, that passes the consumed Siddhi events directly to the streams without any data conversion. PassThrough is the only source mapper inbuilt in Siddhi, and all other source mappers are implemented as extensions. Example 1 Receive JSON messages by exposing an HTTP service, and direct them to InputStream stream for processing. Here the HTTP service will be secured with basic authentication, receives events on all network interfaces on port 8080 and context /foo . The service expects the JSON messages to be on the default data format that's supported by the JSON mapper as follows. { name : Paul , age : 20 , country : UK } The configuration of the HTTP source and JSON source mapper to achieve the above is as follows. @ source ( type = http , receiver . url = http://0.0.0.0:8080/foo , @ map ( type = json )) define stream InputStream ( name string , age int , country string ); Example 2 Receive JSON messages by exposing an HTTP service, and direct them to StockStream stream for processing. Here the incoming JSON , as given bellow, do not adhere to the default data format that's supported by the JSON mapper. { portfolio :{ stock :{ volume : 100 , company :{ symbol : FB }, price : 55.6 } } } The configuration of the HTTP source and the custom JSON source mapping to achieve the above is as follows. @ source ( type = http , receiver . url = http://0.0.0.0:8080/foo , @ map ( type = json , enclosing . element = $.portfolio , @ attributes ( symbol = stock.company.symbol , price = stock.price , volume = stock.volume ))) define stream StockStream ( symbol string , price float , volume long ); The same can also be configured by omitting the attribute names as bellow. @ source ( type = http , receiver . url = http://0.0.0.0:8080/foo , @ map ( type = json , enclosing . element = $.portfolio , @ attributes ( stock.company.symbol , stock.price , stock.volume ))) define stream StockStream ( symbol string , price float , volume long ); Sink Sinks consumes events from streams and publish them via multiple transports to external endpoints in various data formats. A sink configuration allows users to define a mapping to convert the Siddhi events in to the required output data format (such as JSON , TEXT , XML , etc.) and publish the events to the configured endpoints. When customizations to such mappings are not provided, Siddhi converts events to the predefined event format based on the stream definition and the configured message mapper type before publishing the events. Purpose Sink provides a way to publish Siddhi events of a stream to external systems by converting events to their supported format. Syntax To configure a stream to publish events via a sink, add the sink configuration to a stream definition by adding the @sink annotation with the required parameter values. The sink syntax is as follows: @ sink ( type = sink type , static . key = value , dynamic . key = {{ value }} , @ map ( type = map type , static . key = value , dynamic . key = {{ value }} , @ payload ( payload mapping ) ) ) define stream stream name ( attribute1 type , attributeN type ); Dynamic Properties The sink and sink mapper properties that are categorized as dynamic have the ability to absorb attribute values dynamically from the Siddhi events of their associated streams. This can be configured by enclosing the relevant attribute names in double curly braces as {{...}} , and using it within the property values. Some valid dynamic properties values are: '{{attribute1}}' 'This is {{attribute1}}' {{attribute1}} {{attributeN}} Here the attribute names in the double curly braces will be replaced with the values from the events before they are published. This syntax includes the following annotations. Sink The type parameter of the @sink annotation defines the sink type that publishes the events. The other parameters of the @sink annotation depends upon the selected sink type, and here some of its parameters can be optional and/or dynamic. For detailed information about the supported parameters see documentation of the relevant sink. The following is a list of sink types supported by Siddhi: Source type Description In-memory Allow SiddhiApp to publish events to other SiddhiApps running on the same JVM. Log Logs the events appearing on the streams. HTTP Publish events to an HTTP endpoint. Kafka Publish events to Kafka topic. TCP Publish events to a TCP service. WSO2Event Publish WSO2Events via Thrift or TCP protocols. Email Send emails via SMTP protocols. JMS Publish events to JMS topics or queues. File Writes events to files. RabbitMQ Publish events to RabbitMQ topics. MQTT Publish events to MQTT topics. WebSocket Create a web-socket connection or expose a service to publish messages. Amazon SQS Publish events to Amazon SQS. Prometheus Expose data through Prometheus agent. Distributed Sink Distributed Sinks publish events from a defined stream to multiple endpoints using load balancing or partitioning strategies. Any sink can be used as a distributed sink. A distributed sink configuration allows users to define a common mapping to convert and send the Siddhi events for all its destination endpoints. Purpose Distributed sink provides a way to publish Siddhi events to multiple endpoints in the configured event format. Syntax To configure distributed sink add the sink configuration to a stream definition by adding the @sink annotation and add the configuration parameters that are common of all the destination endpoints inside it, along with the common parameters also add the @distribution annotation specifying the distribution strategy (i.e. roundRobin or partitioned ) and @destination annotations providing each endpoint specific configurations. The distributed sink syntax is as follows: RoundRobin Distributed Sink Publishes events to defined destinations in a round robin manner. @ sink ( type = sink type , common . static . key = value , common . dynamic . key = {{ value }} , @ map ( type = map type , static . key = value , dynamic . key = {{ value }} , @ payload ( payload mapping ) ) @ distribution ( strategy = roundRobin , @ destination ( destination . specific . key = value ), @ destination ( destination . specific . key = value ))) ) define stream stream name ( attribute1 type , attributeN type ); Partitioned Distributed Sink Publishes events to defined destinations by partitioning them based on the partitioning key. @ sink ( type = sink type , common . static . key = value , common . dynamic . key = {{ value }} , @ map ( type = map type , static . key = value , dynamic . key = {{ value }} , @ payload ( payload mapping ) ) @ distribution ( strategy = partitioned , partitionKey = partition key , @ destination ( destination . specific . key = value ), @ destination ( destination . specific . key = value ))) ) define stream stream name ( attribute1 type , attributeN type ); Sink Mapper Each @sink configuration can have a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that defines how to convert Siddhi events to outgoing messages with the defined format. The type parameter of the @map defines the map type to be used in converting the outgoing events. The other parameters of @map annotation depends on the mapper selected, and some of its parameters can be optional and/or dynamic. For detailed information about the parameters see the documentation of the relevant mapper. Map Payload @payload is an optional annotation used with @map to define custom mapping. When the @payload annotation is not provided, each mapper maps the outgoing events to its own default event format. The @payload annotation allow users to configure mappers to produce the output payload of their choice, and by using dynamic properties within the payload they can selectively extract and add data from the published Siddhi events. There are two ways you to configure @payload annotation. Some mappers such as XML , JSON , and Test only accept one output payload: @payload( 'This is a test message from {{user}}.') Some mappers such key-value accept series of mapping values: @payload( key1='mapping_1', 'key2'='user : {{user}}') Here, the keys of payload mapping can be defined using the dot notation as a.b.c , or using any constant string value as '$abc' . Supported Sink Mapping Types The following is a list of sink mapping types supported by Siddhi: Sink mapping type Description PassThrough Omits data conversion on outgoing Siddhi events. JSON Converts Siddhi events to JSON messages. XML Converts Siddhi events to XML messages. TEXT Converts Siddhi events to plain text messages. Avro Converts Siddhi events to Avro Events. WSO2Event Converts Siddhi events to WSO2Event events. Binary Converts Siddhi events to Siddhi specific binary events. Key Value Converts Siddhi events to key-value HashMaps. CSV Converts Siddhi events to CSV like delimiter separated events. Tip When the @map annotation is not provided @map(type='passThrough') is used as default, that passes the outgoing Siddhi events directly to the sinks without any data conversion. PassThrough is the only sink mapper inbuilt in Siddhi, and all other sink mappers are implemented as extensions. Example 1 Publishes OutputStream events by converting them to JSON messages with the default format, and by sending to an HTTP endpoint http://localhost:8005/endpoint1 , using POST method, Accept header, and basic authentication having admin is both username and password. The configuration of the HTTP sink and JSON sink mapper to achieve the above is as follows. @ sink ( type = http , publisher . url = http://localhost:8005/endpoint , method = POST , headers = Accept-Date:20/02/2017 , basic . auth . enabled = true , basic . auth . username = admin , basic . auth . password = admin , @ map ( type = json )) define stream OutputStream ( name string , age int , country string ); This will publish a JSON message on the following format: { event :{ name : Paul , age : 20 , country : UK } } Example 2 Publishes StockStream events by converting them to user defined JSON messages, and by sending to an HTTP endpoint http://localhost:8005/stocks . The configuration of the HTTP sink and custom JSON sink mapping to achieve the above is as follows. @ sink ( type = http , publisher . url = http://localhost:8005/stocks , @ map ( type = json , validate . json = true , enclosing . element = $.Portfolio , @ payload ( { StockData :{ Symbol : {{ symbol }} , Price :{{price}} }} ))) define stream StockStream ( symbol string , price float , volume long ); This will publish a single event as the JSON message on the following format: { Portfolio :{ StockData :{ Symbol : GOOG , Price : 55.6 } } } This can also publish multiple events together as a JSON message on the following format: { Portfolio :[ { StockData :{ Symbol : GOOG , Price : 55.6 } }, { StockData :{ Symbol : FB , Price : 57.0 } } ] } Example 3 Publishes events from the OutputStream stream to multiple the HTTP endpoints using a partitioning strategy. Here the events are sent to either http://localhost:8005/endpoint1 or http://localhost:8006/endpoint2 based on the partitioning key country . It uses default JSON mapping, POST method, and used admin as both the username and the password when publishing to both the endpoints. The configuration of the distributed HTTP sink and JSON sink mapper to achieve the above is as follows. @ sink ( type = http , method = POST , basic . auth . enabled = true , basic . auth . username = admin , basic . auth . password = admin , @ map ( type = json ), @ distribution ( strategy = partitioned , partitionKey = country , @ destination ( publisher . url = http://localhost:8005/endpoint1 ), @ destination ( publisher . url = http://localhost:8006/endpoint2 ))) define stream OutputStream ( name string , age int , country string ); This will partition the outgoing events and publish all events with the same country attribute value to the same endpoint. The JSON message published will be on the following format: { event :{ name : Paul , age : 20 , country : UK } } Error Handling Errors in Siddhi can be handled at the Streams and in Sinks. Error Handling at Stream When errors are thrown by Siddhi elements subscribed to the stream, the error gets propagated up to the stream that delivered the event to those Siddhi elements. By default the error is logged and dropped at the stream, but this behavior can be altered by by adding @OnError annotation to the corresponding stream definition. @OnError annotation can help users to capture the error and the associated event, and handle them gracefully by sending them to a fault stream. The @OnError annotation and the required action to be specified as bellow. @ OnError ( action = on error action ) define stream stream name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The action parameter of the @OnError annotation defines the action to be executed during failure scenarios. The following actions can be specified to @OnError annotation to handle erroneous scenarios. LOG : Logs the event with the error, and drops the event. This is the default action performed even when @OnError annotation is not defined. STREAM : Creates a fault stream and redirects the event and the error to it. The created fault stream will have all the attributes defined in the base stream to capture the error causing event, and in addition it also contains _error attribute of type object to containing the error information. The fault stream can be referred by adding ! in front of the base stream name as ! stream name . Example Handle errors in TempStream by redirecting the errors to a fault stream. The configuration of TempStream stream and @OnError annotation is as follows. @ OnError ( name = STREAM ) define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); Siddhi will infer and automatically defines the fault stream of TempStream as given bellow. define stream ! TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double , _error object ); The SiddhiApp extending the above the use-case by adding failure generation and error handling with the use of queries is as follows. Note: Details on writing processing logics via queries will be explained in later sections. -- Define fault stream to handle error occurred at TempStream subscribers @ OnError ( name = STREAM ) define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); -- Error generation through a custom function `createError()` @ name ( error-generation ) from TempStream # custom : createError () insert into IgnoreStream1 ; -- Handling error by simply logging the event and error. @ name ( handle-error ) from ! TempStream # log ( Error Occurred! ) select deviceID , roomNo , temp , _error insert into IgnoreStream2 ; Error Handling at Sink There can be cases where external systems becoming unavailable or coursing errors when the events are published to them. By default sinks log and drop the events causing event losses, and this can be handled gracefully by configuring on.error parameter of the @sink annotation. The on.error parameter of the @sink annotation can be specified as bellow. @ sink ( type = sink type , on . error = on error action , key = value , ...) define stream stream name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The following actions can be specified to on.error parameter of @sink annotation to handle erroneous scenarios. LOG : Logs the event with the error, and drops the event. This is the default action performed even when on.error parameter is not defined on the @sink annotation. WAIT : Publishing threads wait in back-off and re-trying mode, and only send the events when the connection is re-established. During this time the threads will not consume any new messages causing the systems to introduce back pressure on the systems that publishes to it. STREAM : Pushes the failed events with the corresponding error to the associated fault stream the sink belongs to. Example 1 Introduce back pressure on the threads who bring events via TempStream when the system cannot connect to Kafka. The configuration of TempStream stream and @sink Kafka annotation with on.error property is as follows. @ sink ( type = kafka , on . error = WAIT , topic = {{roomNo}} , bootstrap . servers = localhost:9092 , @ map ( type = xml )) define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); Example 2 Send events to the fault stream of TempStream when the system cannot connect to Kafka. The configuration of TempStream stream with associated fault stream, @sink Kafka annotation with on.error property and a queries to handle the error is as follows. Note: Details on writing processing logics via queries will be explained in later sections. @ OnError ( name = STREAM ) @ sink ( type = kafka , on . error = STREAM , topic = {{roomNo}} , bootstrap . servers = localhost:9092 , @ map ( type = xml )) define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); -- Handling error by simply logging the event and error. @ name ( handle-error ) from ! TempStream # log ( Error Occurred! ) select deviceID , roomNo , temp , _error insert into IgnoreStream ; Query Query defines the processing logic in Siddhi. It consumes events from one or more streams, named-windows , tables , and/or named-aggregations , process the events in a streaming manner, and generate output events into a stream , named-window , or table . Purpose A query provides a way to process the events in the order they arrive and produce output using both stateful and stateless complex event processing and stream processing operations. Syntax The high level query syntax for defining processing logics is as follows: @ name ( query name ) from input projection output action The following parameters are used to configure a stream definition. Parameter Description query name The name of the query. Since naming the query (i.e the @name(' query name ') annotation) is optional, when the name is not provided Siddhi assign a system generated name for the query. input Defines the means of event consumption via streams , named-windows , tables , and/or named-aggregations , and defines the processing logic using filters , windows , stream-functions , joins , patterns and sequences . projection Generates output event attributes using select , functions , aggregation-functions , and group by operations, and filters the generated the output using having , limit offset , order by , and output rate limiting operations before sending them out. Here the projection is optional and when it is omitted all the input events will be sent to the output as it is. output action Defines output action (such as insert into , update , delete , etc) that needs to be performed by the generated events on a stream , named-window , or table Example A query consumes events from the TempStream stream and output only the roomNo and temp attributes to the RoomTempStream stream, from which another query consumes the events and sends all its attributes to AnotherRoomTempStream stream. define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); from TempStream select roomNo , temp insert into RoomTempStream ; from RoomTempStream insert into AnotherRoomTempStream ; Inferred Stream Here, the RoomTempStream and AnotherRoomTempStream streams are an inferred streams, which means their stream definitions are inferred from the queries and they can be used same as any other defined stream without any restrictions. Value Values are typed data, that can be manipulated, transferred and stored. Values can be referred by the attributes defined in definitions such as streams, and tables. Siddhi supports values of type STRING , INT (Integer), LONG , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL (Boolean) and OBJECT . The syntax of each type and their example use as a constant value is as follows, Attribute Type Format Example int + 123 , -75 , +95 long +L 123000L , -750l , +154L float ( +)?('.' *)? (E(-|+)? +)?F 123.0f , -75.0e-10F , +95.789f double ( +)?('.' *)? (E(-|+)? +)?D? 123.0 , 123.0D , -75.0e-10D , +95.789d bool (true|false) true , false , TRUE , FALSE string '( char * !('|\"|\"\"\"| line ))' or \"( char * !(\"|\"\"\"| line ))\" or \"\"\"( char * !(\"\"\"))\"\"\" 'Any text.' , \"Text with 'single' quotes.\" , \"\"\" Text with 'single' quotes, \"double\" quotes, and new lines. \"\"\" Time Time is a special type of LONG value that denotes time using digits and their unit in the format ( digit + unit )+ . At execution, the time gets converted into milliseconds and returns a LONG value. Unit Syntax Year year | years Month month | months Week week | weeks Day day | days Hour hour | hours Minutes minute | minutes | min Seconds second | seconds | sec Milliseconds millisecond | milliseconds Example 1 hour and 25 minutes can by written as 1 hour and 25 minutes which is equal to the LONG value 5100000 . Select The select clause in Siddhi query defines the output event attributes of the query. Following are some basic query projection operations supported by select. Action Description Select specific attributes for projection Only select some of the input attributes as query output attributes. E.g., Select and output only roomNo and temp attributes from the TempStream stream. from TempStream select roomNo, temp insert into RoomTempStream; Select all attributes for projection Select all input attributes as query output attributes. This can be done by using asterisk ( * ) or by omitting the select clause itself. E.g., Both following queries select all attributes of TempStream input stream and output all attributes to NewTempStream stream. from TempStream select * insert into NewTempStream; or from TempStream insert into NewTempStream; Name attribute Provide a unique name for each output attribute generated by the query. This can help to rename the selected input attributes or assign an attribute name to a projection operation such as function, aggregate-function, mathematical operation, etc, using as keyword. E.g., Query that renames input attribute temp to temperature and function currentTimeMillis() as time . from TempStream select roomNo, temp as temperature, currentTimeMillis() as time insert into RoomTempStream; Constant values as attributes Creates output attributes with a constant value. Any constant value of type STRING , INT , LONG , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL , and time as given in the values section can be defined. E.g., Query specifying 'C' as the constant value for the scale attribute. from TempStream select roomNo, temp, 'C' as scale insert into RoomTempStream; Mathematical and logical expressions in attributes Defines the mathematical and logical operations that need to be performed to generating output attribute values. These expressions are executed in the precedence order given below. Operator precedence Operator Distribution Example () Scope (cost + tax) * 0.05 IS NULL Null check deviceID is null NOT Logical NOT not (price > 10) * , / , % Multiplication, division, modulus temp * 9/5 + 32 + , - Addition, subtraction temp * 9/5 - 32 < , < = , > , >= Comparators: less-than, greater-than-equal, greater-than, less-than-equal totalCost >= price * quantity == , != Comparisons: equal, not equal totalCost != price * quantity IN Checks if value exist in the table roomNo in ServerRoomsTable AND Logical AND temp < 40 and humidity < 40 OR Logical OR humidity < 40 or humidity >= 60 E.g., Query converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, and identifies rooms with room number between 10 and 15 as server rooms. from TempStream select roomNo, temp * 9/5 + 32 as temp, 'F' as scale, roomNo > 10 and roomNo < 15 as isServerRoom insert into RoomTempStream; Function Function are pre-configured operations that can consumes zero, or more parameters and always produce a single value as result. It can be used anywhere an attribute can be used. Purpose Functions encapsulate pre-configured reusable execution logic allowing users to execute the logic anywhere just by calling the function. This also make writing SiddhiApps simple and easy to understand. Syntax The syntax of function is as follows, function name ( parameter * ) Here function name uniquely identifies the function. The parameter defined input parameters the function can accept. The input parameters can be attributes, constant values, results of other functions, results of mathematical or logical expressions, or time values. The number and type of parameters a function accepts depend on the function itself. Note Functions, mathematical expressions, and logical expressions can be used in a nested manner. Example 1 Function name add accepting two input parameters, is called with an attribute named input and a constant value 75 . add(input, 75) Example 2 Function name alertAfter accepting two input parameters, is called with a time value of 1 hour and 25 minutes and a mathematical addition operation of startTime + 56 . add(1 hour and 25 minutes, startTime + 56) Inbuilt functions Following are some inbuilt Siddhi functions, for more functions refer execution extensions . Inbuilt function Description eventTimestamp Returns event's timestamp. currentTimeMillis Returns current time of SiddhiApp runtime. default Returns a default value if the parameter is null. ifThenElse Returns parameters based on a conditional parameter. UUID Generates a UUID. cast Casts parameter type. convert Converts parameter type. coalesce Returns first not null input parameter. maximum Returns the maximum value of all parameters. minimum Returns the minimum value of all parameters. instanceOfBoolean Checks if the parameter is an instance of Boolean. instanceOfDouble Checks if the parameter is an instance of Double. instanceOfFloat Checks if the parameter is an instance of Float. instanceOfInteger Checks if the parameter is an instance of Integer. instanceOfLong Checks if the parameter is an instance of Long. instanceOfString Checks if the parameter is an instance of String. createSet Creates HashSet with given input parameters. sizeOfSet Returns number of items in the HashSet, that's passed as a parameter. Example Query that converts the roomNo to string using convert function, finds the maximum temperature reading with maximum function, and adds a unique messageID using the UUID function. from TempStream select convert ( roomNo , string ) as roomNo , maximum ( tempReading1 , tempReading2 ) as temp , UUID () as messageID insert into RoomTempStream ; Filter Filters provide a way of filtering input stream events based on a specified condition. It accepts any type of condition including a combination of functions and/or attributes that produces a Boolean result. Filters allow events to passthrough if the condition results in true , and drops if it results in a false . Purpose Filter helps to select the events that are relevant for the processing and omit the ones that are not. Syntax Filter conditions should be defined in square brackets ( [] ) next to the input stream as shown below. from input stream [ filter condition ] select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream Example Query to filter TempStream stream events, having roomNo within the range of 100-210 and temperature greater than 40 degrees, and insert them into HighTempStream stream. from TempStream [( roomNo = 100 and roomNo 210 ) and temp 40 ] select roomNo , temp insert into HighTempStream ; Window Window provides a way to capture a subset of events from an input stream and retain them for a period of time based on a specified criterion. The criterion defines when and how the events should be evicted from the windows. Such as events getting evicted from the window based on the time duration, or number of events and they events are evicted in a sliding (one by one) or tumbling (batch) manner. Within a query, each input stream can at most have only one window associated with it. Purpose Windows help to retain events based on a criterion, such that the values of those events can be aggregated, or checked if an event of interest is within the window or not. Syntax Window should be defined by using the #window prefix next to the input stream as shown below. from input stream # window . window name ( parameter , parameter , ... ) select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert ouput event type ? into output stream Note Filter conditions can be applied both before and/or after the window. Inbuilt windows Following are some inbuilt Siddhi windows, for more windows refer execution extensions . Inbuilt function Description time Retains events based on time in a sliding manner. timeBatch Retains events based on time in a tumbling/batch manner. length Retains events based on number of events in a sliding manner. lengthBatch Retains events based on number of events in a tumbling/batch manner. timeLength Retains events based on time and number of events in a sliding manner. session Retains events for each session based on session key. batch Retains events of last arrived event chunk. sort Retains top-k or bottom-k events based on a parameter value. cron Retains events based on cron time in a tumbling/batch manner. externalTime Retains events based on event time value passed as a parameter in a sliding manner. externalTimeBatch Retains events based on event time value passed as a parameter in a a tumbling/batch manner. delay Retains events and delays the output by the given time period in a sliding manner. Example 1 Query to find out the maximum temperature out of the last 10 events , using the window of length 10 and max() aggregation function, from the TempStream stream and insert the results into the MaxTempStream stream. from TempStream # window . length ( 10 ) select max ( temp ) as maxTemp insert into MaxTempStream ; Here, the length window operates in a sliding manner where the following 3 event subsets are calculated and outputted when a list of 12 events are received in sequential order. Subset Event Range 1 1 - 10 2 2 - 11 3 3 - 12 Example 2 Query to find out the maximum temperature out of the every 10 events , using the window of lengthBatch 10 and max() aggregation function, from the TempStream stream and insert the results into the MaxTempStream stream. from TempStream # window . lengthBatch ( 10 ) select max ( temp ) as maxTemp insert into MaxTempStream ; Here, the window operates in a batch/tumbling manner where the following 3 event subsets are calculated and outputted when a list of 30 events are received in a sequential order. Subset Event Range 1 1 - 10 2 11 - 20 3 21 - 30 Example 3 Query to find out the maximum temperature out of the events arrived during last 10 minutes , using the window of time 10 minutes and max() aggregation function, from the TempStream stream and insert the results into the MaxTempStream stream. from TempStream # window . time ( 10 min ) select max ( temp ) as maxTemp insert into MaxTempStream ; Here, the time window operates in a sliding manner with millisecond accuracy, where it will process events in the following 3 time durations and output aggregated events when a list of events are received in a sequential order. Subset Time Range (in ms) 1 1:00:00.001 - 1:10:00.000 2 1:00:01.001 - 1:10:01.000 3 1:00:01.033 - 1:10:01.034 Example 4 Query to find out the maximum temperature out of the events arriving every 10 minutes , using the window of timeBatch 10 and max() aggregation function, from the TempStream stream and insert the results into the MaxTempStream stream. from TempStream # window . timeBatch ( 10 min ) select max ( temp ) as maxTemp insert into MaxTempStream ; Here, the window operates in a batch/tumbling manner where the window will process evetns in the following 3 time durations and output aggregated events when a list of events are received in a sequential order. Subset Time Range (in ms) 1 1:00:00.001 - 1:10:00.000 2 1:10:00.001 - 1:20:00.000 3 1:20:00.001 - 1:30:00.000 Event Type Query output depends on the current and expired event types it produces based on its internal processing state. By default all queries produce current events upon event arrival to the query. The queries containing windows additionally produce expired events when events expire from the windows. Purpose Event type helps to specify when a query should output events to the stream, such as output upon current events, expired events or upon both current and expired events. Syntax Event type should be defined in between insert and into keywords for insert queries as follows. from input stream # window . window name ( parameter , parameter , ... ) select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert event type into output stream Event type should be defined next to the for keyword for delete queries as follows. from input stream # window . window name ( parameter , parameter , ... ) select attribute name , attribute name , ... delete table ( for event type ) ? on condition Event type should be defined next to the for keyword for update queries as follows. from input stream # window . window name ( parameter , parameter , ... ) select attribute name , attribute name , ... update table ( for event type ) ? set table . attribute name = ( attribute name | expression ) ? , table . attribute name = ( attribute name | expression ) ? , ... on condition Event type should be defined next to the for keyword for update or insert queries as follows. from input stream # window . window name ( parameter , parameter , ... ) select attribute name , attribute name , ... update or insert into table ( for event type ) ? set table . attribute name = expression , table . attribute name = expression , ... on condition Note Controlling query output based on the event types neither alters query execution nor its accuracy. The event types can be defined using the following keywords to manipulate query output. Event types Description current events Outputs events only when incoming events arrive to be processed by the query. This is default behavior when no specific event type is specified. expired events Outputs events only when events expires from the window. all events Outputs events when incoming events arrive to be processed by the query as well as when events expire from the window. Example Query to output only the expired events from a 1 minute time window to the DelayedTempStream stream. This can be used for delaying the events by a minute. from TempStream # window . time ( 1 min ) select * insert expired events into DelayedTempStream Note This is just to illustrate how expired events work, it is recommended to use delay window for usecases where we need to delay events by a given time period. Aggregate Function Aggregate functions are pre-configured aggregation operations that can consumes zero, or more parameters from multiple events and always produce a single value as result. They can be only used in the query projection (as part of the select clause). When a query comprises a window, the aggregation will be contained to the events in the window, and when it does not have a window, the aggregation is performed from the first event the query has received. Purpose Aggregate functions encapsulate pre-configured reusable aggregate logic allowing users to aggregate values of multiple events together. When used with batch/tumbling windows this can also help to reduce the number of output events produced. Syntax Aggregate function can be used in query projection (as part of the select clause) alone or as a part of another expression. In all cases, the output produced by the query should be properly mapped to the output stream attribute using the as keyword. The syntax of aggregate function is as follows, from input stream # window . window name ( parameter , parameter , ... ) select aggregate function ( parameter , parameter , ... ) as attribute name , attribute2 name , ... insert into output stream ; Here aggregate function uniquely identifies the aggregate function. The parameter defined input parameters the aggregate function can accept. The input parameters can be attributes, constant values, results of other functions or aggregate functions, results of mathematical or logical expressions, or time values. The number and type of parameters an aggregate function accepts depend on the function itself. Inbuilt aggregate functions Following are some inbuilt aggregation functions, for more functions refer execution extensions . Inbuilt aggregate function Description sum Calculates the sum from a set of values. count Calculates the count from a set of values. distinctCount Calculates the distinct count based on a parameter from a set of values. avg Calculates the average from a set of values. max Finds the maximum value from a set of values. max Finds the minimum value from a set of values. | maxForever | Finds the maximum value from all events throughout its lifetime irrespective of the windows. | | minForever | Finds the minimum value from all events throughout its lifetime irrespective of the windows. | | stdDev | Calculates the standard deviation from a set of values. | | and | Calculates boolean and from a set of values. | | or | Calculates boolean or from a set of values. | | unionSet | Calculates union as a Set from a set of values. | Example Query to calculate average, maximum, and minimum values on temp attribute of the TempStream stream in a sliding manner, from the events arrived over the last 10 minutes and to produce outputs avgTemp , maxTemp and minTemp respectively to the AvgTempStream output stream. from TempStream # window . time ( 10 min ) select avg ( temp ) as avgTemp , max ( temp ) as maxTemp , min ( temp ) as minTemp insert into AvgTempStream ; Group By Group By provides a way of grouping events based on one or more specified attributes to perform aggregate operations. Purpose Group By allows users to aggregate values of multiple events based on the given group by fields. Syntax The syntax for the Group By aggregate function is as follows. from input stream # window . window name (...) select aggregate function ( parameter , parameter , ...) as attribute1 name , attribute2 name , ... group by attribute1 name , attribute2 name , ... insert into output stream ; Here the group by attributes should be defined next to the group by keyword separating each attribute by a comma. Example Query to calculate the average temp per roomNo and deviceID combination, from the TempStream stream those have arrived during the last 10 minutes time window in a sliding manner. from TempStream # window . time ( 10 min ) select avg ( temp ) as avgTemp , roomNo , deviceID group by roomNo , deviceID insert into AvgTempStream ; Having Having provide a way of filtering events based queries output stream attributes based on a specified condition. It accepts any type of condition including a combination of functions and/or attributes that produces a Boolean result. Having allow events to passthrough if the condition results in true , and drops if it results in a false . Purpose Having helps to select the events that are relevant for the output based on the attributes those are produced by the select statement and omit the ones that are not. Syntax The syntax for the Having clause is as follows. from input stream # window . window name ( ... ) select aggregate function ( parameter , parameter , ...) as attribute1 name , attribute2 name , ... group by attribute1 name , attribute2 name ... having condition insert into output stream ; Here the having condition should be defined next to the having keyword and having can be used with or without group by statement. Example The following query calculates the average temperature per room for the last 10 minutes, and alerts if it exceeds 30 degrees. from TempStream # window . time ( 10 min ) select avg ( temp ) as avgTemp , roomNo group by roomNo having avgTemp 30 insert into AlertStream ; Order By Order By, orders the query results in ascending and or descending order based on one or more specified attributes. When order by is defined based on an attribute, Siddhi by default orders the events in ascending order, and by adding desc keyword, the events can be ordered in descending order. Syntax The syntax for the Order By clause is as follows: from input stream # window . window name ( ... ) select aggregate function ( parameter , parameter , ...) as attribute1 name , attribute2 name , ... group by attribute1 name , attribute2 name ... having condition order by attribute1 name ( asc | desc ) ? , attribute2 name ( asc | desc ) ? , ... insert into output stream ; Here the group by attributes should be defined next to the group by keyword separating each by a comma, and optionally specifying event ordering using asc or desc keywords. Example Query to calculate the average temperature per roomNo and deviceID combination for every 10 minutes, and order the generated output events in ascending order by avgTemp and then in descending order by roomNo (if the more than one event have the same avgTemp value). from TempStream # window . timeBatch ( 10 min ) select avg ( temp ) as avgTemp , roomNo , deviceID group by roomNo , deviceID order by avgTemp , roomNo desc insert into AvgTempStream ; Limit Offset When events are emitted as a batch, offset allows you to offset beginning of the output event batch and limit allows you to limit the number of events in the batch from the defined offset. With this users can specify which set of events need be emitted. Syntax The syntax for the Limit Offset clause is as follows: from input stream # window . window name ( ... ) select aggregate function ( parameter , parameter , ...) as attribute1 name , attribute2 name , ... group by attribute1 name , attribute2 name ... having condition order by attribute1 name ( asc | desc ) ? , attribute2 name ( ascend / descend ) ? , ... limit positive interger ? offset positive interger ? insert into output stream ; Here both limit and offset are optional where limit by default output all the events and offset by default set to 0 . Example The following query calculates the average temperature per roomNo and deviceID combination, for events that arrive at the TempStream stream for every 10 minutes and emits two events with highest average temperature. from TempStream # window . timeBatch ( 10 min ) select avg ( temp ) as avgTemp , roomNo , deviceID group by roomNo , deviceID order by avgTemp desc limit 2 insert into HighestAvgTempStream ; The following query calculates the average temperature per roomNo and deviceID combination, for events that arrive at the TempStream stream for every 10 minutes and emits third, forth and fifth events when sorted in descending order based on their average temperature. from TempStream # window . timeBatch ( 10 min ) select avg ( temp ) as avgTemp , roomNo , deviceID group by roomNo , deviceID order by avgTemp desc limit 3 offset 2 insert into HighestAvgTempStream ; Join (Stream) Joins allow you to get a combined result from two streams in real-time based on a specified condition. Purpose Streams are stateless. Therefore, in order to join two streams, they need to be connected to a window so that there is a pool of events that can be used for joining. Joins also accept conditions to join the appropriate events from each stream. During the joining process each incoming event of each stream is matched against all the events in the other stream's window based on the given condition, and the output events are generated for all the matching event pairs. Note Join can also be performed with stored data , aggregation or externally named windows . Syntax The syntax for a join is as follows: from input stream # window . window name ( parameter , ... ) { unidirectional } { as reference } join input stream # window . window name ( parameter , ... ) { unidirectional } { as reference } on join condition select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream Here, the join condition allows you to match the attributes from both the streams. Unidirectional join operation By default, events arriving at either stream can trigger the joining process. However, if you want to control the join execution, you can add the unidirectional keyword next to a stream in the join definition as depicted in the syntax in order to enable that stream to trigger the join operation. Here, events arriving at other stream only update the window of that stream, and this stream does not trigger the join operation. Note The unidirectional keyword cannot be applied to both the input streams because the default behaviour already allows both streams to trigger the join operation. Example Assuming that the temperature of regulators are updated every minute. Following is a Siddhi App that controls the temperature regulators if they are not already on for all the rooms with a room temperature greater than 30 degrees. define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); define stream RegulatorStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , isOn bool ); from TempStream [ temp 30 . 0 ] # window . time ( 1 min ) as T join RegulatorStream [ isOn == false ] # window . length ( 1 ) as R on T . roomNo == R . roomNo select T . roomNo , R . deviceID , start as action insert into RegulatorActionStream ; Supported join types Following are the supported operations of a join clause. Inner join (join) This is the default behaviour of a join operation. join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. The output is generated only if there is a matching event in both the streams. Left outer join The left outer join operation allows you to join two streams to be merged based on a condition. left outer join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. Here, it returns all the events of left stream even if there are no matching events in the right stream by having null values for the attributes of the right stream. Example The following query generates output events for all events from the StockStream stream regardless of whether a matching symbol exists in the TwitterStream stream or not. from StockStream#window.time(1 min) as S left outer join TwitterStream#window.length(1) as T on S.symbol== T.symbol select S.symbol as symbol, T.tweet, S.price insert into outputStream ; Right outer join This is similar to a left outer join. Right outer join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. It returns all the events of the right stream even if there are no matching events in the left stream. Full outer join The full outer join combines the results of left outer join and right outer join. full outer join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. Here, output event are generated for each incoming event even if there are no matching events in the other stream. Example The following query generates output events for all the incoming events of each stream regardless of whether there is a match for the symbol attribute in the other stream or not. from StockStream#window.time(1 min) as S full outer join TwitterStream#window.length(1) as T on S.symbol== T.symbol select S.symbol as symbol, T.tweet, S.price insert into outputStream ; Pattern This is a state machine implementation that allows you to detect patterns in the events that arrive over time. This can correlate events within a single stream or between multiple streams. Purpose Patterns allow you to identify trends in events over a time period. Syntax The following is the syntax for a pattern query: from ( every ) ? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ] - ( every ) ? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ] - ... ( within time gap ) ? select event reference . attribute name , event reference . attribute name , ... insert into output stream Items Description - This is used to indicate an event that should be following another event. The subsequent event does not necessarily have to occur immediately after the preceding event. The condition to be met by the preceding event should be added before the sign, and the condition to be met by the subsequent event should be added after the sign. event reference This allows you to add a reference to the the matching event so that it can be accessed later for further processing. (within time gap )? The within clause is optional. It defines the time duration within which all the matching events should occur. every every is an optional keyword. This defines whether the event matching should be triggered for every event arrival in the specified stream with the matching condition. When this keyword is not used, the matching is carried out only once. Siddhi also supports pattern matching with counting events and matching events in a logical order such as ( and , or , and not ). These are described in detail further below in this guide. Example This query sends an alert if the temperature of a room increases by 5 degrees within 10 min. from every ( e1 = TempStream ) - e2 = TempStream [ e1 . roomNo == roomNo and ( e1 . temp + 5 ) = temp ] within 10 min select e1 . roomNo , e1 . temp as initialTemp , e2 . temp as finalTemp insert into AlertStream ; Here, the matching process begins for each event in the TempStream stream (because every is used with e1=TempStream ), and if another event arrives within 10 minutes with a value for the temp attribute that is greater than or equal to e1.temp + 5 of the event e1, an output is generated via the AlertStream . Counting Pattern Counting patterns allow you to match multiple events that may have been received for the same matching condition. The number of events matched per condition can be limited via condition postfixes. Syntax Each matching condition can contain a collection of events with the minimum and maximum number of events to be matched as shown in the syntax below. from ( every ) ? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ] ( min count : max count ) ? - ... ( within time gap ) ? select event reference ([ event index ]) ? . attribute name , ... insert into output stream Postfix Description Example n1:n2 This matches n1 to n2 events (including n1 and not more than n2 ). 1:4 matches 1 to 4 events. n: This matches n or more events (including n ). 2: matches 2 or more events. :n This matches up to n events (excluding n ). :5 matches up to 5 events. n This matches exactly n events. 5 matches exactly 5 events. Specific occurrences of the event in a collection can be retrieved by using an event index with its reference. Square brackets can be used to indicate the event index where 1 can be used as the index of the first event and last can be used as the index for the last available event in the event collection. If you provide an index greater then the last event index, the system returns null . The following are some valid examples. e1[3] refers to the 3rd event. e1[last] refers to the last event. e1[last - 1] refers to the event before the last event. Example The following Siddhi App calculates the temperature difference between two regulator events. define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); define stream RegulatorStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , tempSet double , isOn bool ); from every ( e1 = RegulatorStream ) - e2 = TempStream [ e1 . roomNo == roomNo ] 1 : - e3 = RegulatorStream [ e1 . roomNo == roomNo ] select e1 . roomNo , e2 [ 0 ]. temp - e2 [ last ]. temp as tempDiff insert into TempDiffStream ; Logical Patterns Logical patterns match events that arrive in temporal order and correlate them with logical relationships such as and , or and not . Syntax from ( every ) ? ( not ) ? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ] (( and | or ) event reference = input stream [ filter condition ]) ? ( within time gap ) ? - ... select event reference ([ event index ]) ? . attribute name , ... insert into output stream Keywords such as and , or , or not can be used to illustrate the logical relationship. Key Word Description and This allows both conditions of and to be matched by two events in any order. or The state succeeds if either condition of or is satisfied. Here the event reference of the other condition is null . not condition1 and condition2 When not is included with and , it identifies the events that match arriving before any event that match . not condition for time period When not is included with for , it allows you to identify a situation where no event that matches condition1 arrives during the specified time period . e.g., from not TemperatureStream[temp 60] for 5 sec . Here the not pattern can be followed by either an and clause or the effective period of not can be concluded after a given time period . Further in Siddhi more than two streams cannot be matched with logical conditions using and , or , or not clauses at this point. Detecting Non-occurring Events Siddhi allows you to detect non-occurring events via multiple combinations of the key words specified above as shown in the table below. In the patterns listed, P* can be either a regular event pattern, an absent event pattern or a logical pattern. Pattern Detected Scenario not A for time period The non-occurrence of event A within time period after system start up. e.g., Generating an alert if a taxi has not reached its destination within 30 minutes, to indicate that the passenger might be in danger. not A for time period and B After system start up, event A does not occur within time period , but event B occurs at some point in time. e.g., Generating an alert if a taxi has not reached its destination within 30 minutes, and the passenger marked that he/she is in danger at some point in time. not A for time period 1 and not B for time period 2 After system start up, event A doess not occur within time period 1 , and event B also does not occur within time period 2 . e.g., Generating an alert if the driver of a taxi has not reached the destination within 30 minutes, and the passenger has not marked himself/herself to be in danger within that same time period. not A for time period or B After system start up, either event A does not occur within time period , or event B occurs at some point in time. e.g., Generating an alert if the taxi has not reached its destination within 30 minutes, or if the passenger has marked that he/she is in danger at some point in time. not A for time period 1 or not B for time period 2 After system start up, either event A does not occur within time period 1 , or event B occurs within time period 2 . e.g., Generating an alert to indicate that the driver is not on an expected route if the taxi has not reached destination A within 20 minutes, or reached destination B within 30 minutes. A \u2192 not B for time period Event B does not occur within time period after the occurrence of event A. e.g., Generating an alert if the taxi has reached its destination, but this was not followed by a payment record. P* \u2192 not A for time period and B After the occurrence of P*, event A does not occur within time period , and event B occurs at some point in time. P* \u2192 not A for time period 1 and not B for time period 2 After the occurrence of P*, event A does not occur within time period 1 , and event B does not occur within time period 2 . P* \u2192 not A for time period or B After the occurrence of P*, either event A does not occur within time period , or event B occurs at some point in time. P* \u2192 not A for time period 1 or not B for time period 2 After the occurrence of P*, either event A does not occur within time period 1 , or event B does not occur within time period 2 . not A for time period \u2192 B Event A does occur within time period after the system start up, but event B occurs after that time period has elapsed. not A for time period and B \u2192 P* Event A does not occur within time period , and event B occurs at some point in time. Then P* occurs after the time period has elapsed, and after B has occurred. not A for time period 1 and not B for time period 2 \u2192 P* After system start up, event A does not occur within time period 1 , and event B does not occur within time period 2 . However, P* occurs after both A and B. not A for time period or B \u2192 P* After system start up, event A does not occur within time period or event B occurs at some point in time. The P* occurs after time period has elapsed, or after B has occurred. not A for time period 1 or not B for time period 2 \u2192 P* After system start up, either event A does not occur within time period 1 , or event B does not occur within time period 2 . Then P* occurs after both time period 1 and time period 2 have elapsed. not A and B Event A does not occur before event B. A and not B Event B does not occur before event A. Example Following Siddhi App, sends the stop control action to the regulator when the key is removed from the hotel room. define stream RegulatorStateChangeStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , tempSet double , action string ); define stream RoomKeyStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , action string ); from every ( e1 = RegulatorStateChangeStream [ action == on ] ) - e2 = RoomKeyStream [ e1 . roomNo == roomNo and action == removed ] or e3 = RegulatorStateChangeStream [ e1 . roomNo == roomNo and action == off ] select e1 . roomNo , ifThenElse ( e2 is null , none , stop ) as action having action != none insert into RegulatorActionStream ; This Siddhi Application generates an alert if we have switch off the regulator before the temperature reaches 12 degrees. define stream RegulatorStateChangeStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , tempSet double , action string ); define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); from e1 = RegulatorStateChangeStream [ action == start ] - not TempStream [ e1 . roomNo == roomNo and temp 12 ] and e2 = RegulatorStateChangeStream [ action == off ] select e1 . roomNo as roomNo insert into AlertStream ; This Siddhi Application generates an alert if the temperature does not reduce to 12 degrees within 5 minutes of switching on the regulator. define stream RegulatorStateChangeStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , tempSet double , action string ); define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); from e1 = RegulatorStateChangeStream [ action == start ] - not TempStream [ e1 . roomNo == roomNo and temp 12 ] for 5 min select e1 . roomNo as roomNo insert into AlertStream ; Sequence Sequence is a state machine implementation that allows you to detect the sequence of event occurrences over time. Here all matching events need to arrive consecutively to match the sequence condition, and there cannot be any non-matching events arriving within a matching sequence of events. This can correlate events within a single stream or between multiple streams. Purpose This allows you to detect a specified event sequence over a specified time period. Syntax The syntax for a sequence query is as follows: from ( every ) ? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ], event reference = input stream [ filter condition ], ... ( within time gap ) ? select event reference . attribute name , event reference . attribute name , ... insert into output stream Items Description , This represents the immediate next event i.e., when an event that matches the first condition arrives, the event that arrives immediately after it should match the second condition. event reference This allows you to add a reference to the the matching event so that it can be accessed later for further processing. (within time gap )? The within clause is optional. It defines the time duration within which all the matching events should occur. every every is an optional keyword. This defines whether the matching event should be triggered for every event that arrives at the specified stream with the matching condition. When this keyword is not used, the matching is carried out only once. Example This query generates an alert if the increase in the temperature between two consecutive temperature events exceeds one degree. from every e1 = TempStream , e2 = TempStream [ e1 . temp + 1 temp ] select e1 . temp as initialTemp , e2 . temp as finalTemp insert into AlertStream ; Counting Sequence Counting sequences allow you to match multiple events for the same matching condition. The number of events matched per condition can be limited via condition postfixes such as Counting Patterns , or by using the * , + , and ? operators. The matching events can also be retrieved using event indexes, similar to how it is done in Counting Patterns . Syntax Each matching condition in a sequence can contain a collection of events as shown below. from ( every ) ? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ]( +|*|? ) ? , event reference = input stream [ filter condition ]( +|*|? ) ? , ... ( within time gap ) ? select event reference . attribute name , event reference . attribute name , ... insert into output stream Postfix symbol Required/Optional Description + Optional This matches one or more events to the given condition. * Optional This matches zero or more events to the given condition. ? Optional This matches zero or one events to the given condition. Example This Siddhi application identifies temperature peeks. define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); from every e1 = TempStream , e2 = TempStream [ e1 . temp = temp ] + , e3 = TempStream [ e2 [ last ]. temp temp ] select e1 . temp as initialTemp , e2 [ last ]. temp as peakTemp insert into PeekTempStream ; Logical Sequence Logical sequences identify logical relationships using and , or and not on consecutively arriving events. Syntax The syntax for a logical sequence is as follows: from ( every ) ? ( not ) ? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ] (( and | or ) event reference = input stream [ filter condition ]) ? ( within time gap ) ? , ... select event reference ([ event index ]) ? . attribute name , ... insert into output stream Keywords such as and , or , or not can be used to illustrate the logical relationship, similar to how it is done in Logical Patterns . Example This Siddhi application notifies the state when a regulator event is immediately followed by both temperature and humidity events. define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , temp double ); define stream HumidStream ( deviceID long , humid double ); define stream RegulatorStream ( deviceID long , isOn bool ); from every e1 = RegulatorStream , e2 = TempStream and e3 = HumidStream select e2 . temp , e3 . humid insert into StateNotificationStream ; Output rate limiting Output rate limiting allows queries to output events periodically based on a specified condition. Purpose This allows you to limit the output to avoid overloading the subsequent executions, and to remove unnecessary information. Syntax The syntax of an output rate limiting configuration is as follows: from input stream ... select attribute name , attribute name , ... output rate limiting configuration insert into output stream Siddhi supports three types of output rate limiting configurations as explained in the following table: Rate limiting configuration Syntax Description Based on time output event every time interval This outputs output event every time interval time interval. Based on number of events output event every event interval events This outputs output event for every event interval number of events. Snapshot based output snapshot every time interval This outputs all events in the window (or the last event if no window is defined in the query) for every given time interval time interval. Here the output event specifies the event(s) that should be returned as the output of the query. The possible values are as follows: * first : Only the first event processed by the query during the specified time interval/sliding window is emitted. * last : Only the last event processed by the query during the specified time interval/sliding window is emitted. * all : All the events processed by the query during the specified time interval/sliding window are emitted. When no output event is defined, all is used by default. Examples Returning events based on the number of events Here, events are emitted every time the specified number of events arrive. You can also specify whether to emit only the first event/last event, or all the events out of the events that arrived. In this example, the last temperature per sensor is emitted for every 10 events. from TempStreamselect select temp, deviceID group by deviceID output last every 10 events insert into LowRateTempStream; Returning events based on time Here events are emitted for every predefined time interval. You can also specify whether to emit only the first event, last event, or all events out of the events that arrived during the specified time interval. In this example, emits all temperature events every 10 seconds from TempStreamoutput output every 10 sec insert into LowRateTempStream; Returning a periodic snapshot of events This method works best with windows. When an input stream is connected to a window, snapshot rate limiting emits all the current events that have arrived and do not have corresponding expired events for every predefined time interval. If the input stream is not connected to a window, only the last current event for each predefined time interval is emitted. This query emits a snapshot of the events in a time window of 5 seconds every 1 second. from TempStream#window.time(5 sec) output snapshot every 1 sec insert into SnapshotTempStream; Partition Partitions divide streams and queries into isolated groups in order to process them in parallel and in isolation. A partition can contain one or more queries and there can be multiple instances where the same queries and streams are replicated for each partition. Each partition is tagged with a partition key. Those partitions only process the events that match the corresponding partition key. Purpose Partitions allow you to process the events groups in isolation so that event processing can be performed using the same set of queries for each group. Partition key generation A partition key can be generated in the following two methods: Partition by value This is created by generating unique values using input stream attributes. Syntax partition with ( expression of stream name , expression of stream name , ... ) begin query query ... end; Example This query calculates the maximum temperature recorded within the last 10 events per deviceID . partition with ( deviceID of TempStream ) begin from TempStream#window.length(10) select roomNo, deviceID, max(temp) as maxTemp insert into DeviceTempStream; end; Partition by range This is created by mapping each partition key to a range condition of the input streams numerical attribute. Syntax partition with ( condition as partition key or condition as partition key or ... of stream name , ... ) begin query query ... end; Example This query calculates the average temperature for the last 10 minutes per office area. partition with ( roomNo = 1030 as 'serverRoom' or roomNo 1030 and roomNo = 330 as 'officeRoom' or roomNo 330 as 'lobby' of TempStream) begin from TempStream#window.time(10 min) select roomNo, deviceID, avg(temp) as avgTemp insert into AreaTempStream end; Inner Stream Queries inside a partition block can use inner streams to communicate with each other while preserving partition isolation. Inner streams are denoted by a \"#\" placed before the stream name, and these streams cannot be accessed outside a partition block. Purpose Inner streams allow you to connect queries within the partition block so that the output of a query can be used as an input only by another query within the same partition. Therefore, you do not need to repartition the streams if they are communicating within the partition. Example This partition calculates the average temperature of every 10 events for each sensor, and sends an output to the DeviceTempIncreasingStream stream if the consecutive average temperature values increase by more than 5 degrees. partition with ( deviceID of TempStream ) begin from TempStream#window.lengthBatch(10) select roomNo, deviceID, avg(temp) as avgTemp insert into #AvgTempStream from every (e1=#AvgTempStream),e2=#AvgTempStream[e1.avgTemp + 5 < avgTemp] select e1.deviceID, e1.avgTemp as initialAvgTemp, e2.avgTemp as finalAvgTemp insert into DeviceTempIncreasingStream end; Purge Partition Based on the partition key used for the partition, multiple instances of streams and queries will be generated. When an extremely large number of unique partition keys are used there is a possibility of very high instances of streams and queries getting generated and eventually system going out of memory. In order to overcome this, users can define a purge interval to clean partitions that will not be used anymore. Purpose @purge allows you to clean the partition instances that will not be used anymore. Syntax The syntax of partition purge configuration is as follows: @ purge ( enable = true , interval = purge interval , idle . period = idle period of partition instance ) partition with ( partition key of input stream ) begin from input stream ... select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream end ; Partition purge configuration Description Purge interval The periodic time interval to purge the purgeable partition instances. Idle period of partition instance The period, a particular partition instance (for a given partition key) needs to be idle before it becomes purgeable. Examples Mark partition instances eligible for purging, if there are no events from a particular deviceID for 15 seconds, and periodically purge those partition instances every 1 second. @ purge ( enable = true , interval = 1 sec , idle . period = 15 sec ) partition with ( deviceID of TempStream ) begin from TempStream # window . lengthBatch ( 10 ) select roomNo , deviceID , avg ( temp ) as avgTemp insert into # AvgTempStream from every ( e1 =# AvgTempStream ), e2 =# AvgTempStream [ e1 . avgTemp + 5 avgTemp ] select e1 . deviceID , e1 . avgTemp as initialAvgTemp , e2 . avgTemp as finalAvgTemp insert into DeviceTempIncreasingStream end ; Table A table is a stored version of an stream or a table of events. Its schema is defined via the table definition that is similar to a stream definition. These events are by default stored in-memory , but Siddhi also provides store extensions to work with data/events stored in various data stores through the table abstraction. Purpose Tables allow Siddhi to work with stored events. By defining a schema for tables Siddhi enables them to be processed by queries using their defined attributes with the streaming data. You can also interactively query the state of the stored events in the table. Syntax The syntax for a new table definition is as follows: define table table name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The following parameters are configured in a table definition: Parameter Description table name The name of the table defined. ( PascalCase is used for table name as a convention.) attribute name The schema of the table is defined by its attributes with uniquely identifiable attribute names ( camelCase is used for attribute names as a convention.) attribute type The type of each attribute defined in the schema. This can be STRING , INT , LONG , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL or OBJECT . Example The following defines a table named RoomTypeTable with roomNo and type attributes of data types int and string respectively. define table RoomTypeTable ( roomNo int , type string ); Primary Keys Tables can be configured with primary keys to avoid the duplication of data. Primary keys are configured by including the @PrimaryKey( 'key1', 'key2' ) annotation to the table definition. Each event table configuration can have only one @PrimaryKey annotation. The number of attributes supported differ based on the table implementations. When more than one attribute is used for the primary key, the uniqueness of the events stored in the table is determined based on the combination of values for those attributes. Examples This query creates an event table with the symbol attribute as the primary key. Therefore each entry in this table must have a unique value for symbol attribute. @ PrimaryKey ( symbol ) define table StockTable ( symbol string , price float , volume long ); Indexes Indexes allow tables to be searched/modified much faster. Indexes are configured by including the @Index( 'key1', 'key2' ) annotation to the table definition. Each event table configuration can have 0-1 @Index annotations. Support for the @Index annotation and the number of attributes supported differ based on the table implementations. When more then one attribute is used for index, each one of them is used to index the table for fast access of the data. Indexes can be configured together with primary keys. Examples This query creates an indexed event table named RoomTypeTable with the roomNo attribute as the index key. @ Index ( roomNo ) define table RoomTypeTable ( roomNo int , type string ); Store Store is a table that refers to data/events stored in data stores outside of Siddhi such as RDBMS, Cassandra, etc. Store is defined via the @store annotation, and the store schema is defined via a table definition associated with it. Purpose Store allows Siddhi to search, retrieve and manipulate data stored in external data stores through Siddhi queries. Syntax The syntax for a defining store and it's associated table definition is as follows: @ store ( type = store_type , static . option . key1 = static_option_value1 , static . option . keyN = static_option_valueN ) define table TableName ( attribute1 Type1 , attributeN TypeN ); Example The following defines a RDBMS data store pointing to a MySQL database with name hotel hosted in loacalhost:3306 having a table RoomTypeTable with columns roomNo of INTEGER and type of VARCHAR(255) mapped to Siddhi data types int and string respectively. @ Store ( type = rdbms , jdbc . url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hotel , username = siddhi , password = 123 , jdbc . driver . name = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver ) define table RoomTypeTable ( roomNo int , type string ); Supported Store Types The following is a list of currently supported store types: RDBMS (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, DB2, H2) Solr MongoDB HBase Redis Cassandra Operators on Table (and Store) The following operators can be performed on tables (and stores). Insert This allows events to be inserted into tables. This is similar to inserting events into streams. Warning If the table is defined with primary keys, and if you insert duplicate data, primary key constrain violations can occur. In such cases use the update or insert into operation. Syntax from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into table Similar to streams, you need to use the current events , expired events or the all events keyword between insert and into keywords in order to insert only the specific event types. For more information, see Event Type Example This query inserts all the events from the TempStream stream to the TempTable table. from TempStream select * insert into TempTable ; Join (Table) This allows a stream to retrieve information from a table in a streaming manner. Note Joins can also be performed with two streams , aggregation or against externally named windows . Syntax from input stream join table on condition select ( input stream | table ). attribute name , ( input stream | table ). attribute name , ... insert into output stream Note A table can only be joint with a stream. Two tables cannot be joint because there must be at least one active entity to trigger the join operation. Example This Siddhi App performs a join to retrieve the room type from RoomTypeTable table based on the room number, so that it can filter the events related to server-room s. define table RoomTypeTable ( roomNo int , type string ); define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); from TempStream join RoomTypeTable on RoomTypeTable . roomNo == TempStream . roomNo select deviceID , RoomTypeTable . type as roomType , type , temp having roomType == server-room insert into ServerRoomTempStream ; Supported join types Table join supports following join operations. Inner join (join) This is the default behaviour of a join operation. join is used as the keyword to join the stream with the table. The output is generated only if there is a matching event in both the stream and the table. Left outer join The left outer join operation allows you to join a stream on left side with a table on the right side based on a condition. Here, it returns all the events of left stream even if there are no matching events in the right table by having null values for the attributes of the right table. Right outer join This is similar to a left outer join . right outer join is used as the keyword to join a stream on right side with a table on the left side based on a condition. It returns all the events of the right stream even if there are no matching events in the left table. Delete To delete selected events that are stored in a table. Syntax from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... delete table ( for event type ) ? on condition The condition element specifies the basis on which events are selected to be deleted. When specifying the condition, table attributes should be referred to with the table name. To execute delete for specific event types, use the current events , expired events or the all events keyword with for as shown in the syntax. For more information, see Event Type Note Table attributes must be always referred to with the table name as follows: table name . attibute name Example In this example, the script deletes a record in the RoomTypeTable table if it has a value for the roomNo attribute that matches the value for the roomNumber attribute of an event in the DeleteStream stream. define table RoomTypeTable ( roomNo int , type string ); define stream DeleteStream ( roomNumber int ); from DeleteStream delete RoomTypeTable on RoomTypeTable . roomNo == roomNumber ; Update This operator updates selected event attributes stored in a table based on a condition. Syntax from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... update table ( for event type ) ? set table . attribute name = ( attribute name | expression ) ? , table . attribute name = ( attribute name | expression ) ? , ... on condition The condition element specifies the basis on which events are selected to be updated. When specifying the condition , table attributes must be referred to with the table name. You can use the set keyword to update selected attributes from the table. Here, for each assignment, the attribute specified in the left must be the table attribute, and the one specified in the right can be a stream/table attribute a mathematical operation, or other. When the set clause is not provided, all the attributes in the table are updated. To execute an update for specific event types use the current events , expired events or the all events keyword with for as shown in the syntax. For more information, see Event Type . Note Table attributes must be always referred to with the table name as shown below: table name . attibute name . Example This Siddhi application updates the room occupancy in the RoomOccupancyTable table for each room number based on new arrivals and exits from the UpdateStream stream. define table RoomOccupancyTable ( roomNo int , people int ); define stream UpdateStream ( roomNumber int , arrival int , exit int ); from UpdateStream select * update RoomOccupancyTable set RoomOccupancyTable . people = RoomOccupancyTable . people + arrival - exit on RoomOccupancyTable . roomNo == roomNumber ; Update or Insert This allows you update if the event attributes already exist in the table based on a condition, or else insert the entry as a new attribute. Syntax from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... update or insert into table ( for event type ) ? set table . attribute name = expression , table . attribute name = expression , ... on condition The condition element specifies the basis on which events are selected for update. When specifying the condition , table attributes should be referred to with the table name. If a record that matches the condition does not already exist in the table, the arriving event is inserted into the table. The set clause is only used when an update is performed during the insert/update operation. When set clause is used, the attribute to the left is always a table attribute, and the attribute to the right can be a stream/table attribute, mathematical operation or other. The attribute to the left (i.e., the attribute in the event table) is updated with the value of the attribute to the right if the given condition is met. When the set clause is not provided, all the attributes in the table are updated. Note When the attribute to the right is a table attribute, the operations supported differ based on the database type. To execute update upon specific event types use the current events , expired events or the all events keyword with for as shown in the syntax. To understand more see Event Type . Note Table attributes should be always referred to with the table name as table name . attibute name . Example The following query update for events in the UpdateTable event table that have room numbers that match the same in the UpdateStream stream. When such events are found in the event table, they are updated. When a room number available in the stream is not found in the event table, it is inserted from the stream. define table RoomAssigneeTable ( roomNo int , type string , assignee string ); define stream RoomAssigneeStream ( roomNumber int , type string , assignee string ); from RoomAssigneeStream select roomNumber as roomNo , type , assignee update or insert into RoomAssigneeTable set RoomAssigneeTable . assignee = assignee on RoomAssigneeTable . roomNo == roomNo ; In This allows the stream to check whether the expected value exists in the table as a part of a conditional operation. Syntax from input stream [ condition in table ] select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream The condition element specifies the basis on which events are selected to be compared. When constructing the condition , the table attribute must be always referred to with the table name as shown below: table . attibute name . Example This Siddhi application filters only room numbers that are listed in the ServerRoomTable table. define table ServerRoomTable ( roomNo int ); define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); from TempStream [ ServerRoomTable . roomNo == roomNo in ServerRoomTable ] insert into ServerRoomTempStream ; Named Aggregation Named aggregation allows you to obtain aggregates in an incremental manner for a specified set of time periods. This not only allows you to calculate aggregations with varied time granularity, but also allows you to access them in an interactive manner for reports, dashboards, and for further processing. Its schema is defined via the aggregation definition . Purpose Named aggregation allows you to retrieve the aggregate values for different time durations. That is, it allows you to obtain aggregates such as sum , count , avg , min , max , count and distinctCount of stream attributes for durations such as sec , min , hour , etc. This is of considerable importance in many Analytics scenarios because aggregate values are often needed for several time periods. Furthermore, this ensures that the aggregations are not lost due to unexpected system failures because aggregates can be stored in different persistence stores . Syntax @ store ( type = store type , ...) @ purge ( enable = true or false , interval = purging interval , @ retentionPeriod ( granularity = retention period , ...) ) define aggregation aggregator name from input stream select attribute name , aggregate function ( attribute name ) as attribute name , ... group by attribute name aggregate by timestamp attribute every time periods ; The above syntax includes the following: Item Description @store This annotation is used to refer to the data store where the calculated aggregate results are stored. This annotation is optional. When no annotation is provided, the data is stored in the in-memory store. @purge This annotation is used to configure purging in aggregation granularities. If this annotation is not provided, the default purging mentioned above is applied. If you want to disable automatic data purging, you can use this annotation as follows: '@purge(enable=false) /You should disable data purging if the aggregation query in included in the Siddhi application for read-only purposes. @retentionPeriod This annotation is used to specify the length of time the data needs to be retained when carrying out data purging. If this annotation is not provided, the default retention period is applied. aggregator name This specifies a unique name for the aggregation so that it can be referred when accessing aggregate results. input stream The stream that feeds the aggregation. Note! this stream should be already defined. group by attribute name The group by clause is optional. If it is included in a Siddhi application, aggregate values are calculated per each group by attribute. If it is not used, all the events are aggregated together. by timestamp attribute This clause is optional. This defines the attribute that should be used as the timestamp. If this clause is not used, the event time is used by default. The timestamp could be given as either a string or a long value. If it is a long value, the unix timestamp in milliseconds is expected (e.g. 1496289950000 ). If it is a string value, the supported formats are yyyy - MM - dd HH : mm : ss (if time is in GMT) and yyyy - MM - dd HH : mm : ss Z (if time is not in GMT), here the ISO 8601 UTC offset must be provided for Z . (e.g., +05:30 , -11:00 ). time periods Time periods can be specified as a range where the minimum and the maximum value are separated by three dots, or as comma-separated values. e.g., A range can be specified as sec...year where aggregation is done per second, minute, hour, day, month and year. Comma-separated values can be specified as min, hour. Skipping time durations (e.g., min, day where the hour duration is skipped) when specifying comma-separated values is supported only from v4.1.1 onwards Aggregation's granularity data holders are automatically purged every 15 minutes. When carrying out data purging, the retention period you have specified for each granularity in the named aggregation query is taken into account. The retention period defined for a granularity needs to be greater than or equal to its minimum retention period as specified in the table below. If no valid retention period is defined for a granularity, the default retention period (as specified in the table below) is applied. Granularity Default retention Minimum retention second 120 seconds 120 seconds minute 24 hours 120 minutes hour 30 days 25 hours day 1 year 32 days month All 13 month year All none Note Aggregation is carried out at calendar start times for each granularity with the GMT timezone Note The same aggregation can be defined in multiple Siddhi apps for joining, however, only one siddhi app should carry out the processing (i.e. the aggregation input stream should only feed events to one aggregation definition). Example This Siddhi Application defines an aggregation named TradeAggregation to calculate the average and sum for the price attribute of events arriving at the TradeStream stream. These aggregates are calculated per every time granularity in the second-year range. define stream TradeStream ( symbol string , price double , volume long , timestamp long ); @ purge ( enable = true , interval = 10 sec , @ retentionPeriod ( sec = 120 sec , min = 24 hours , hours = 30 days , days = 1 year , months = all , years = all )) define aggregation TradeAggregation from TradeStream select symbol , avg ( price ) as avgPrice , sum ( price ) as total group by symbol aggregate by timestamp every sec ... year ; Distributed Aggregation Distributed Aggregation allows you to partially process aggregations in different shards. This allows Siddhi app in one shard to be responsible only for processing a part of the aggregation. However for this, all aggregations must be based on a common physical database(@store). Syntax @ store ( type = store type , ...) @ PartitionById define aggregation aggregator name from input stream select attribute name , aggregate function ( attribute name ) as attribute name , ... group by attribute name aggregate by timestamp attribute every time periods ; Following table includes the annotation to be used to enable distributed aggregation, Item Description @PartitionById If the annotation is given, then the distributed aggregation is enabled. Further this can be disabled by using enable element, @PartitionById(enable='false') . Further, following system properties are also available, System Property Description Possible Values Optional Default Value shardId The id of the shard one of the distributed aggregation is running in. This should be unique to a single shard Any string No partitionById This allows user to enable/disable distributed aggregation for all aggregations running in one siddhi manager .(Available from v4.3.3) true/false Yesio false Note ShardIds should not be changed after the first configuration in order to keep data consistency. Join (Aggregation) This allows a stream to retrieve calculated aggregate values from the aggregation. Note A join can also be performed with two streams , with a table and a stream, or with a stream against externally named windows . Syntax A join with aggregation is similer to the join with table , but with additional within and per clauses. from input stream join aggrigation on join condition within time range per time granularity select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream ; Apart from constructs of table join this includes the following. Please note that the 'on' condition is optional : Item Description within time range This allows you to specify the time interval for which the aggregate values need to be retrieved. This can be specified by providing the start and end time separated by a comma as string or long values, or by using the wildcard string specifying the data range. For details refer examples. per time granularity This specifies the time granularity by which the aggregate values must be grouped and returned. e.g., If you specify days , the retrieved aggregate values are grouped for each day within the selected time interval. within and per clauses also accept attribute values from the stream. The timestamp of the aggregations can be accessed through the AGG_TIMESTAMP attribute. Example Following aggregation definition will be used for the examples. define stream TradeStream ( symbol string , price double , volume long , timestamp long ); define aggregation TradeAggregation from TradeStream select AGG_TIMESTAMP , symbol , avg ( price ) as avgPrice , sum ( price ) as total group by symbol aggregate by timestamp every sec ... year ; This query retrieves daily aggregations within the time range \"2014-02-15 00:00:00 +05:30\", \"2014-03-16 00:00:00 +05:30\" (Please note that +05:30 can be omitted if timezone is GMT) define stream StockStream ( symbol string , value int ); from StockStream as S join TradeAggregation as T on S . symbol == T . symbol within 2014-02-15 00:00:00 +05:30 , 2014-03-16 00:00:00 +05:30 per days select S . symbol , T . total , T . avgPrice insert into AggregateStockStream ; This query retrieves hourly aggregations within the day 2014-02-15 . define stream StockStream ( symbol string , value int ); from StockStream as S join TradeAggregation as T on S . symbol == T . symbol within 2014-02-15 **:**:** +05:30 per hours select S . symbol , T . total , T . avgPrice insert into AggregateStockStream ; This query retrieves all aggregations per perValue stream attribute within the time period between timestamps 1496200000000 and 1596434876000 . define stream StockStream ( symbol string , value int , perValue string ); from StockStream as S join TradeAggregation as T on S . symbol == T . symbol within 1496200000000 L , 1596434876000 L per S . perValue select S . symbol , T . total , T . avgPrice insert into AggregateStockStream ; Supported join types Aggregation join supports following join operations. Inner join (join) This is the default behaviour of a join operation. join is used as the keyword to join the stream with the aggregation. The output is generated only if there is a matching event in the stream and the aggregation. Left outer join The left outer join operation allows you to join a stream on left side with a aggregation on the right side based on a condition. Here, it returns all the events of left stream even if there are no matching events in the right aggregation by having null values for the attributes of the right aggregation. Right outer join This is similar to a left outer join . right outer join is used as the keyword to join a stream on right side with a aggregation on the left side based on a condition. It returns all the events of the right stream even if there are no matching events in the left aggregation. Named Window A named window is a window that can be shared across multiple queries. Events can be inserted to a named window from one or more queries and it can produce output events based on the named window type. Syntax The syntax for a named window is as follows: define window window name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ) window type ( parameter , parameter , \u2026 ) event type ; The following parameters are configured in a table definition: Parameter Description window name The name of the window defined. ( PascalCase is used for window names as a convention.) attribute name The schema of the window is defined by its attributes with uniquely identifiable attribute names ( camelCase is used for attribute names as a convention.) attribute type The type of each attribute defined in the schema. This can be STRING , INT , LONG , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL or OBJECT . window type ( parameter , ...) The window type associated with the window and its parameters. output event type This is optional. Keywords such as current events , expired events and all events (the default) can be used to specify when the window output should be exposed. For more information, see Event Type . Examples Returning all output when events arrive and when events expire from the window. In this query, the event type is not specified. Therefore, it returns both current and expired events as the output. define window SensorWindow ( name string , value float , roomNo int , deviceID string ) timeBatch ( 1 second ); Returning an output only when events expire from the window. In this query, the event type of the window is expired events . Therefore, it only returns the events that have expired from the window as the output. define window SensorWindow ( name string , value float , roomNo int , deviceID string ) timeBatch ( 1 second ) output expired events ; Operators on Named Windows The following operators can be performed on named windows. Insert This allows events to be inserted into windows. This is similar to inserting events into streams. Syntax from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into window To insert only events of a specific event type, add the current events , expired events or the all events keyword between insert and into keywords (similar to how it is done for streams). For more information, see Event Type . Example This query inserts all events from the TempStream stream to the OneMinTempWindow window. define stream TempStream ( tempId string , temp double ); define window OneMinTempWindow ( tempId string , temp double ) time ( 1 min ); from TempStream select * insert into OneMinTempWindow ; Join (Window) To allow a stream to retrieve information from a window based on a condition. Note A join can also be performed with two streams , aggregation or with tables tables . Syntax from input stream join window on condition select ( input stream | window ). attribute name , ( input stream | window ). attribute name , ... insert into output stream Example This Siddhi Application performs a join count the number of temperature events having more then 40 degrees within the last 2 minutes. define window TwoMinTempWindow ( roomNo int , temp double ) time ( 2 min ); define stream CheckStream ( requestId string ); from CheckStream as C join TwoMinTempWindow as T on T . temp 40 select requestId , count ( T . temp ) as count insert into HighTempCountStream ; Supported join types Window join supports following operations of a join clause. Inner join (join) This is the default behaviour of a join operation. join is used as the keyword to join two windows or a stream with a window. The output is generated only if there is a matching event in both stream/window. Left outer join The left outer join operation allows you to join two windows or a stream with a window to be merged based on a condition. Here, it returns all the events of left stream/window even if there are no matching events in the right stream/window by having null values for the attributes of the right stream/window. Right outer join This is similar to a left outer join. Right outer join is used as the keyword to join two windows or a stream with a window. It returns all the events of the right stream/window even if there are no matching events in the left stream/window. Full outer join The full outer join combines the results of left outer join and right outer join . full outer join is used as the keyword to join two windows or a stream with a window. Here, output event are generated for each incoming event even if there are no matching events in the other stream/window. From A window can be an input to a query, similar to streams. Note !!! When window is used as an input to a query, another window cannot be applied on top of this. Syntax from window select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream Example This Siddhi Application calculates the maximum temperature within the last 5 minutes. define window FiveMinTempWindow ( roomNo int , temp double ) time ( 5 min ); from FiveMinTempWindow select max ( temp ) as maxValue , roomNo insert into MaxSensorReadingStream ; Trigger Triggers allow events to be periodically generated. Trigger definition can be used to define a trigger. A trigger also works like a stream with a predefined schema. Purpose For some use cases the system should be able to periodically generate events based on a specified time interval to perform some periodic executions. A trigger can be performed for a 'start' operation, for a given time interval , or for a given ' cron expression ' . Syntax The syntax for a trigger definition is as follows. define trigger trigger name at ( start | every time interval | cron expression ); Similar to streams, triggers can be used as inputs. They adhere to the following stream definition and produce the triggered_time attribute of the long type. define stream trigger name ( triggered_time long ); The following types of triggeres are currently supported: Trigger type Description 'start' An event is triggered when Siddhi is started. every time interval An event is triggered periodically at the given time interval. ' cron expression ' An event is triggered periodically based on the given cron expression. For configuration details, see quartz-scheduler . Examples Triggering events regularly at specific time intervals The following query triggers events every 5 minutes. define trigger FiveMinTriggerStream at every 5 min ; Triggering events at a specific time on specified days The following query triggers an event at 10.15 AM on every weekdays. define trigger FiveMinTriggerStream at 0 15 10 ? * MON-FRI ; Script Scripts allow you to write functions in other programming languages and execute them within Siddhi queries. Functions defined via scripts can be accessed in queries similar to any other inbuilt function. Function definitions can be used to define these scripts. Function parameters are passed into the function logic as Object[] and with the name data . Purpose Scripts allow you to define a function operation that is not provided in Siddhi core or its extension. It is not required to write an extension to define the function logic. Syntax The syntax for a Script definition is as follows. define function function name [ language name ] return return type { operation of the function } ; The following parameters are configured when defining a script. Parameter Description function name The name of the function ( camelCase is used for the function name) as a convention. language name The name of the programming language used to define the script, such as javascript , r and scala . return type The attribute type of the function\u2019s return. This can be int , long , float , double , string , bool or object . Here the function implementer should be responsible for returning the output attribute on the defined return type for proper functionality. operation of the function Here, the execution logic of the function is added. This logic should be written in the language specified under the language name , and it should return the output in the data type specified via the return type parameter. Examples This query performs concatenation using JavaScript, and returns the output as a string. define function concatFn [ javascript ] return string { var str1 = data [ 0 ]; var str2 = data [ 1 ]; var str3 = data [ 2 ]; var responce = str1 + str2 + str3 ; return responce ; } ; define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); from TempStream select concatFn ( roomNo , - , deviceID ) as id , temp insert into DeviceTempStream ; Store Query Siddhi store queries are a set of on-demand queries that can be used to perform operations on Siddhi tables, windows, and aggregators. Purpose Store queries allow you to execute the following operations on Siddhi tables, windows, and aggregators without the intervention of streams. Queries supported for tables: SELECT INSERT DELETE UPDATE UPDATE OR INSERT Queries supported for windows and aggregators: SELECT This is be done by submitting the store query to the Siddhi application runtime using its query() method. In order to execute store queries, the Siddhi application of the Siddhi application runtime you are using, should have a store defined, which contains the table that needs to be queried. Example If you need to query the table named RoomTypeTable the it should have been defined in the Siddhi application. In order to execute a store query on RoomTypeTable , you need to submit the store query using query() method of SiddhiAppRuntime instance as below. siddhiAppRuntime . query ( store query ); (Table/Window) Select The SELECT store query retrieves records from the specified table or window, based on the given condition. Syntax from table / window on condition ? select attribute name , attribute name , ... group by ? having ? order by ? limit ? Example This query retrieves room numbers and types of the rooms starting from room no 10. from roomTypeTable on roomNo = 10 ; select roomNo , type (Aggregation) Select The SELECT store query retrieves records from the specified aggregation, based on the given condition, time range, and granularity. Syntax from aggregation on condition ? within time range per time granularity select attribute name , attribute name , ... group by ? having ? order by ? limit ? Example Following aggregation definition will be used for the examples. define stream TradeStream ( symbol string , price double , volume long , timestamp long ); define aggregation TradeAggregation from TradeStream select symbol , avg ( price ) as avgPrice , sum ( price ) as total group by symbol aggregate by timestamp every sec ... year ; This query retrieves daily aggregations within the time range \"2014-02-15 00:00:00 +05:30\", \"2014-03-16 00:00:00 +05:30\" (Please note that +05:30 can be omitted if timezone is GMT) from TradeAggregation within 2014-02-15 00:00:00 +05:30 , 2014-03-16 00:00:00 +05:30 per days select symbol , total , avgPrice ; This query retrieves hourly aggregations of \"FB\" symbol within the day 2014-02-15 . from TradeAggregation on symbol == FB within 2014-02-15 **:**:** +05:30 per hours select symbol , total , avgPrice ; Insert This allows you to insert a new record to the table with the attribute values you define in the select section. Syntax select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into table ; Example This store query inserts a new record to the table RoomOccupancyTable , with the specified attribute values. select 10 as roomNo , 2 as people insert into RoomOccupancyTable Delete The DELETE store query deletes selected records from a specified table. Syntax select ? delete table on conditional expresssion The condition element specifies the basis on which records are selected to be deleted. Note Table attributes must always be referred to with the table name as shown below: table name . attibute name . Example In this example, query deletes a record in the table named RoomTypeTable if it has value for the roomNo attribute that matches the value for the roomNumber attribute of the selection which has 10 as the actual value. select 10 as roomNumber delete RoomTypeTable on RoomTypeTable . roomNo == roomNumber ; delete RoomTypeTable on RoomTypeTable . roomNo == 10 ; Update The UPDATE store query updates selected attributes stored in a specific table, based on a given condition. Syntax select attribute name , attribute name , ... ? update table set table . attribute name = ( attribute name | expression ) ? , table . attribute name = ( attribute name | expression ) ? , ... on condition The condition element specifies the basis on which records are selected to be updated. When specifying the condition , table attributes must be referred to with the table name. You can use the set keyword to update selected attributes from the table. Here, for each assignment, the attribute specified in the left must be the table attribute, and the one specified in the right can be a stream/table attribute a mathematical operation, or other. When the set clause is not provided, all the attributes in the table are updated. Note Table attributes must always be referred to with the table name as shown below: table name . attibute name . Example The following query updates the room occupancy by increasing the value of people by 1, in the RoomOccupancyTable table for each room number greater than 10. select 10 as roomNumber , 1 as arrival update RoomTypeTable set RoomTypeTable . people = RoomTypeTable . people + arrival on RoomTypeTable . roomNo == roomNumber ; update RoomTypeTable set RoomTypeTable . people = RoomTypeTable . people + 1 on RoomTypeTable . roomNo == 10 ; Update or Insert This allows you to update selected attributes if a record that meets the given conditions already exists in the specified table. If a matching record does not exist, the entry is inserted as a new record. Syntax select attribute name , attribute name , ... update or insert into table set table . attribute name = expression , table . attribute name = expression , ... on condition The condition element specifies the basis on which records are selected for update. When specifying the condition , table attributes should be referred to with the table name. If a record that matches the condition does not already exist in the table, the arriving event is inserted into the table. The set clause is only used when an update is performed during the insert/update operation. When set clause is used, the attribute to the left is always a table attribute, and the attribute to the right can be a stream/table attribute, mathematical operation or other. The attribute to the left (i.e., the attribute in the event table) is updated with the value of the attribute to the right if the given condition is met. When the set clause is not provided, all the attributes in the table are updated. Note Table attributes must always be referred to with the table name as shown below: table name . attibute name . Example The following query tries to update the records in the RoomAssigneeTable table that have room numbers that match the same in the selection. If such records are not found, it inserts a new record based on the values provided in the selection. select 10 as roomNo , single as type , abc as assignee update or insert into RoomAssigneeTable set RoomAssigneeTable . assignee = assignee on RoomAssigneeTable . roomNo == roomNo ; Extensions Siddhi supports an extension architecture to enhance its functionality by incorporating other libraries in a seamless manner. Purpose Extensions are supported because, Siddhi core cannot have all the functionality that's needed for all the use cases, mostly use cases require different type of functionality, and for some cases there can be gaps and you need to write the functionality by yourself. All extensions have a namespace. This is used to identify the relevant extensions together, and to let you specifically call the extension. Syntax Extensions follow the following syntax; namespace : function name ( parameter , parameter , ... ) The following parameters are configured when referring a script function. Parameter Description namespace Allows Siddhi to identify the extension without conflict function name The name of the function referred. parameter The function input parameter for function execution. Extension Types Siddhi supports following extension types: Function For each event, it consumes zero or more parameters as input parameters and returns a single attribute. This can be used to manipulate existing event attributes to generate new attributes like any Function operation. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.executor.function.FunctionExecutor . Example : math:sin(x) Here, the sin function of math extension returns the sin value for the x parameter. Aggregate Function For each event, it consumes zero or more parameters as input parameters and returns a single attribute with aggregated results. This can be used in conjunction with a window in order to find the aggregated results based on the given window like any Aggregate Function operation. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.selector.attribute.aggregator.AttributeAggregatorExecutor . Example : custom:std(x) Here, the std aggregate function of custom extension returns the standard deviation of the x value based on its assigned window query. Window This allows events to be collected, generated, dropped and expired anytime without altering the event format based on the given input parameters, similar to any other Window operator. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.window.WindowProcessor . Example : custom:unique(key) Here, the unique window of the custom extension retains one event for each unique key parameter. Stream Function This allows events to be generated or dropped only during event arrival and altered by adding one or more attributes to it. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.function.StreamFunctionProcessor . Example : custom:pol2cart(theta,rho) Here, the pol2cart function of the custom extension returns all the events by calculating the cartesian coordinates x y and adding them as new attributes to the events. Stream Processor This allows events to be collected, generated, dropped and expired anytime by altering the event format by adding one or more attributes to it based on the given input parameters. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.StreamProcessor . Example : custom:perMinResults( parameter , parameter , ...) Here, the perMinResults function of the custom extension returns all events by adding one or more attributes to the events based on the conversion logic. Altered events are output every minute regardless of event arrivals. Sink Sinks provide a way to publish Siddhi events to external systems in the preferred data format. Sinks publish events from the streams via multiple transports to external endpoints in various data formats. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.Sink . Example : @sink(type='sink_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') To configure a stream to publish events via a sink, add the sink configuration to a stream definition by adding the @sink annotation with the required parameter values. The sink syntax is as above Source Source allows Siddhi to consume events from external systems , and map the events to adhere to the associated stream. Sources receive events via multiple transports and in various data formats, and direct them into streams for processing. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.input.source.Source . Example : @source(type='source_type', static.option.key1='static_option_value1') To configure a stream that consumes events via a source, add the source configuration to a stream definition by adding the @source annotation with the required parameter values. The source syntax is as above Store You can use Store extension type to work with data/events stored in various data stores through the table abstraction . You can find more information about these extension types under the heading 'Extension types' in this document. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.table.record.AbstractRecordTable . Script Scripts allow you to define a function operation that is not provided in Siddhi core or its extension. It is not required to write an extension to define the function logic. Scripts allow you to write functions in other programming languages and execute them within Siddhi queries. Functions defined via scripts can be accessed in queries similar to any other inbuilt function. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.function.Script . Source Mapper Each @source configuration has a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that converts the incoming messages format to Siddhi events .The type parameter of the @map defines the map type to be used to map the data. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.SourceMapper . Example : @map(type='map_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') Sink Mapper Each @sink configuration has a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that converts the outgoing Siddhi events to configured messages format .The type parameter of the @map defines the map type to be used to map the data. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.SinkMapper . Example : @map(type='map_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') Example A window extension created with namespace foo and function name unique can be referred as follows: from StockExchangeStream [ price = 20 ] # window . foo : unique ( symbol ) select symbol , price insert into StockQuote Available Extensions Siddhi currently has several pre written extensions that are available here We value your contribution on improving Siddhi and its extensions further. Writing Custom Extensions Custom extensions can be written in order to cater use case specific logic that are not available in Siddhi out of the box or as an existing extension. There are five types of Siddhi extensions that you can write to cater your specific use cases. These extension types and the related maven archetypes are given below. You can use these archetypes to generate Maven projects for each extension type. Follow the procedure for the required archetype, based on your project: Note When using the generated archetype please make sure you complete the @Extension annotation with proper values. This annotation will be used to identify and document the extension, hence your extension will not work without @Extension annotation. siddhi-execution Siddhi-execution provides following extension types: Function Aggregate Function Stream Function Stream Processor Window You can use one or more from above mentioned extension types and implement according to your requirement.

Siddhi Streaming SQL uses SQL like syntax, and annotations to consume events from diverse event sources with various data formats, process then using stateful and stateless operators and send outputs to multiple endpoints according to their accepted event formats. It also supports exposing rule based and adaptive decision making as service endpoints such that external programs and systems can synchronously get decision support form Siddhi.

This file is called as the Siddhi Application or the SiddhiApp . SiddhiApps are named by adding @app:name(' name ') annotation on the top of the SiddhiApp file. When the annotation is not added Siddhi assigns a random UUID as the name of the SiddhiApp. Purpose SiddhiApp provides an isolated execution environment for your processing logic that allows you to deploy and execute processing logic independent of other SiddhiApp in the system. Therefore it's always recommended to have a processing logic related to single use case in a single SiddhiApp. This will help you to group processing logic and easily manage addition and removal of various use cases. The following diagram depicts some of the key Siddhi Streaming SQL elements of Siddhi Application and how event flows through the elements. Below table provides brief description of a few key elements in the Siddhi Streaming SQL Language. Elements Description Stream A logical series of events ordered in time with a uniquely identifiable name, and a defined set of typed attributes defining its schema. Event An event is a single event object associated with a stream. All events of a stream contains a timestamp and an identical set of typed attributes based on the schema of the stream they belong to. Table A structured representation of data stored with a defined schema. Stored data can be backed by In-Memory , or external data stores such as RDBMS , MongoDB , etc. The tables can be accessed and manipulated at runtime. Named Window A structured representation of data stored with a defined schema and eviction policy. Window data is stored In-Memory and automatically cleared by the named window constrain. Other siddhi elements can only query the values in windows at runtime but they cannot modify them. Named Aggregation A structured representation of data that's incrementally aggregated and stored with a defined schema and aggregation granularity such as seconds, minutes, hours, etc. Aggregation data is stored both In-Memory and in external data stores such as RDBMS . Other siddhi elements can only query the values in windows at runtime but they cannot modify them. Query A logical construct that processes events in streaming manner by by consuming data from one or more streams, tables, windows and aggregations, and publishes output events into a stream, table or a window. Source A construct that consumes data from external sources (such as TCP , Kafka , HTTP , etc) with various event formats such as XML , JSON , binary , etc, convert then to Siddhi events, and passes into streams for processing. Sink A construct that consumes events arriving at a stream, maps them to a predefined data format (such as XML , JSON , binary , etc), and publishes them to external endpoints (such as E-mail , TCP , Kafka , HTTP , etc). Input Handler A mechanism to programmatically inject events into streams. Stream/Query Callback A mechanism to programmatically consume output events from streams or queries. Partition A logical container that isolates the processing of queries based on the partition keys derived from the events. Inner Stream A positionable stream that connects portioned queries with each other within the partition. Grammar SiddhiApp is a collection of Siddhi Streaming SQL elements composed together as a script. Here each Siddhi element must be separated by a semicolon ; . Hight level syntax of SiddhiApp is as follows. siddhi app : app annotation * ( stream definition | table definition | ... ) + ( query | partition ) + ; Example Siddhi Application with name Temperature-Analytics defined with a stream named TempStream and a query named 5minAvgQuery . @ app : name ( Temperature-Analytics ) define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); @ name ( 5minAvgQuery ) from TempStream # window . time ( 5 min ) select roomNo , avg ( temp ) as avgTemp group by roomNo insert into OutputStream ;","title":"Siddhi Application"},{"location":"documentation/siddhi-5.x/query-guide-5.x/#stream","text":"A stream is a logical series of events ordered in time. Its schema is defined via the stream definition . A stream definition contains the stream name and a set of attributes with specific types and uniquely identifiable names within the stream. All events associated to the stream will have the same schema (i.e., have the same attributes in the same order). Purpose Stream groups common types of events together with a schema. This helps in various ways such as, processing all events together in queries and performing data format transformations together when they are consumed and published via sources and sinks. Syntax The syntax for defining a new stream is as follows. define stream stream name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The following parameters are used to configure a stream definition. Parameter Description stream name The name of the stream created. (It is recommended to define a stream name in PascalCase .) attribute name Uniquely identifiable name of the stream attribute. (It is recommended to define attribute names in camelCase .) attribute type The type of each attribute defined in the schema. This can be STRING , INT , LONG , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL or OBJECT . To use and refer stream and attribute names that do not follow [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]* format enclose them in ` . E.g. `$test(0)` . To make the stream process events in multi-threading and asynchronous way use the @Async annotation as shown in Multi-threading and Asynchronous Processing configuration section.

Error Handling at Stream When errors are thrown by Siddhi elements subscribed to the stream, the error gets propagated up to the stream that delivered the event to those Siddhi elements. By default the error is logged and dropped at the stream, but this behavior can be altered by by adding @OnError annotation to the corresponding stream definition. @OnError annotation can help users to capture the error and the associated event, and handle them gracefully by sending them to a fault stream. The @OnError annotation and the required action to be specified as bellow. @ OnError ( action = on error action ) define stream stream name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The action parameter of the @OnError annotation defines the action to be executed during failure scenarios. The following actions can be specified to @OnError annotation to handle erroneous scenarios. LOG : Logs the event with the error, and drops the event. This is the default action performed even when @OnError annotation is not defined. STREAM : Creates a fault stream and redirects the event and the error to it. The created fault stream will have all the attributes defined in the base stream to capture the error causing event, and in addition it also contains _error attribute of type object to containing the error information. The fault stream can be referred by adding ! in front of the base stream name as ! stream name . Example Handle errors in TempStream by redirecting the errors to a fault stream.

TempStream # log ( Error Occurred! ) select deviceID , roomNo , temp , _error insert into IgnoreStream2 ; Error Handling at Sink There can be cases where external systems becoming unavailable or coursing errors when the events are published to them. By default sinks log and drop the events causing event losses, and this can be handled gracefully by configuring on.error parameter of the @sink annotation. The on.error parameter of the @sink annotation can be specified as bellow. @ sink ( type = sink type , on . error = on error action , key = value , ...) define stream stream name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The following actions can be specified to on.error parameter of @sink annotation to handle erroneous scenarios. LOG : Logs the event with the error, and drops the event. This is the default action performed even when on.error parameter is not defined on the @sink annotation. WAIT : Publishing threads wait in back-off and re-trying mode, and only send the events when the connection is re-established. During this time the threads will not consume any new messages causing the systems to introduce back pressure on the systems that publishes to it. STREAM : Pushes the failed events with the corresponding error to the associated fault stream the sink belongs to. Example 1 Introduce back pressure on the threads who bring events via TempStream when the system cannot connect to Kafka.

Joins also accept conditions to join the appropriate events from each stream. During the joining process each incoming event of each stream is matched against all the events in the other stream's window based on the given condition, and the output events are generated for all the matching event pairs.

Unidirectional join operation By default, events arriving at either stream can trigger the joining process. However, if you want to control the join execution, you can add the unidirectional keyword next to a stream in the join definition as depicted in the syntax in order to enable that stream to trigger the join operation. Here, events arriving at other stream only update the window of that stream, and this stream does not trigger the join operation. Note The unidirectional keyword cannot be applied to both the input streams because the default behaviour already allows both streams to trigger the join operation. Example Assuming that the temperature of regulators are updated every minute. Following is a Siddhi App that controls the temperature regulators if they are not already on for all the rooms with a room temperature greater than 30 degrees. define stream TempStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , temp double ); define stream RegulatorStream ( deviceID long , roomNo int , isOn bool ); from TempStream [ temp 30 . 0 ] # window . time ( 1 min ) as T join RegulatorStream [ isOn == false ] # window . length ( 1 ) as R on T . roomNo == R . roomNo select T . roomNo , R . deviceID , start as action insert into RegulatorActionStream ; Supported join types Following are the supported operations of a join clause. Inner join (join) This is the default behaviour of a join operation. join is used as the keyword to join both the streams.

(within time gap )? The within clause is optional. It defines the time duration within which all the matching events should occur. every every is an optional keyword. This defines whether the matching event should be triggered for every event that arrives at the specified stream with the matching condition. When this keyword is not used, the matching is carried out only once. Example This query generates an alert if the increase in the temperature between two consecutive temperature events exceeds one degree. from every e1 = TempStream , e2 = TempStream [ e1 . temp + 1 temp ] select e1 . temp as initialTemp , e2 . temp as finalTemp insert into AlertStream ; Counting Sequence Counting sequences allow you to match multiple events for the same matching condition. The number of events matched per condition can be limited via condition postfixes such as Counting Patterns , or by using the * , + , and ? operators. The matching events can also be retrieved using event indexes, similar to how it is done in Counting Patterns .

Syntax The syntax of an output rate limiting configuration is as follows: from input stream ... select attribute name , attribute name , ... output rate limiting configuration insert into output stream Siddhi supports three types of output rate limiting configurations as explained in the following table: Rate limiting configuration Syntax Description Based on time output event every time interval This outputs output event every time interval time interval. Based on number of events output event every event interval events This outputs output event for every event interval number of events. Snapshot based output snapshot every time interval This outputs all events in the window (or the last event if no window is defined in the query) for every given time interval time interval. Here the output event specifies the event(s) that should be returned as the output of the query. The possible values are as follows: * first : Only the first event processed by the query during the specified time interval/sliding window is emitted. * last : Only the last event processed by the query during the specified time interval/sliding window is emitted. * all : All the events processed by the query during the specified time interval/sliding window are emitted. When no output event is defined, all is used by default. Examples Returning events based on the number of events Here, events are emitted every time the specified number of events arrive.

Its schema is defined via the table definition that is similar to a stream definition. These events are by default stored in-memory , but Siddhi also provides store extensions to work with data/events stored in various data stores through the table abstraction. Purpose Tables allow Siddhi to work with stored events. By defining a schema for tables Siddhi enables them to be processed by queries using their defined attributes with the streaming data. You can also interactively query the state of the stored events in the table. Syntax The syntax for a new table definition is as follows: define table table name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The following parameters are configured in a table definition: Parameter Description table name The name of the table defined. ( PascalCase is used for table name as a convention.) attribute name The schema of the table is defined by its attributes with uniquely identifiable attribute names ( camelCase is used for attribute names as a convention.) attribute type The type of each attribute defined in the schema. This can be STRING , INT , LONG , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL or OBJECT . Example The following defines a table named RoomTypeTable with roomNo and type attributes of data types int and string respectively. define table RoomTypeTable ( roomNo int , type string ); Primary Keys Tables can be configured with primary keys to avoid the duplication of data. Primary keys are configured by including the @PrimaryKey( 'key1', 'key2' ) annotation to the table definition. Each event table configuration can have only one @PrimaryKey annotation. The number of attributes supported differ based on the table implementations. When more than one attribute is used for the primary key, the uniqueness of the events stored in the table is determined based on the combination of values for those attributes. Examples This query creates an event table with the symbol attribute as the primary key. Therefore each entry in this table must have a unique value for symbol attribute. @ PrimaryKey ( symbol ) define table StockTable ( symbol string , price float , volume long ); Indexes Indexes allow tables to be searched/modified much faster. Indexes are configured by including the @Index( 'key1', 'key2' ) annotation to the table definition. Each event table configuration can have 0-1 @Index annotations. Support for the @Index annotation and the number of attributes supported differ based on the table implementations. When more then one attribute is used for index, each one of them is used to index the table for fast access of the data. Indexes can be configured together with primary keys.

Purpose Extensions are supported because, Siddhi core cannot have all the functionality that's needed for all the use cases, mostly use cases require different type of functionality, and for some cases there can be gaps and you need to write the functionality by yourself. All extensions have a namespace. This is used to identify the relevant extensions together, and to let you specifically call the extension. Syntax Extensions follow the following syntax; namespace : function name ( parameter , parameter , ... ) The following parameters are configured when referring a script function. Parameter Description namespace Allows Siddhi to identify the extension without conflict function name The name of the function referred. parameter The function input parameter for function execution. Extension Types Siddhi supports following extension types: Function For each event, it consumes zero or more parameters as input parameters and returns a single attribute. This can be used to manipulate existing event attributes to generate new attributes like any Function operation. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.executor.function.FunctionExecutor . Example : math:sin(x) Here, the sin function of math extension returns the sin value for the x parameter. Aggregate Function For each event, it consumes zero or more parameters as input parameters and returns a single attribute with aggregated results. This can be used in conjunction with a window in order to find the aggregated results based on the given window like any Aggregate Function operation. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.selector.attribute.aggregator.AttributeAggregatorExecutor . Example : custom:std(x) Here, the std aggregate function of custom extension returns the standard deviation of the x value based on its assigned window query. Window This allows events to be collected, generated, dropped and expired anytime without altering the event format based on the given input parameters, similar to any other Window operator. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.window.WindowProcessor . Example : custom:unique(key) Here, the unique window of the custom extension retains one event for each unique key parameter. Stream Function This allows events to be generated or dropped only during event arrival and altered by adding one or more attributes to it. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.function.StreamFunctionProcessor . Example : custom:pol2cart(theta,rho) Here, the pol2cart function of the custom extension returns all the events by calculating the cartesian coordinates x y and adding them as new attributes to the events. Stream Processor This allows events to be collected, generated, dropped and expired anytime by altering the event format by adding one or more attributes to it based on the given input parameters. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.StreamProcessor . Example : custom:perMinResults( parameter , parameter , ...) Here, the perMinResults function of the custom extension returns all events by adding one or more attributes to the events based on the conversion logic. Altered events are output every minute regardless of event arrivals. Sink Sinks provide a way to publish Siddhi events to external systems in the preferred data format. Sinks publish events from the streams via multiple transports to external endpoints in various data formats. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.Sink . Example : @sink(type='sink_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') To configure a stream to publish events via a sink, add the sink configuration to a stream definition by adding the @sink annotation with the required parameter values. The sink syntax is as above Source Source allows Siddhi to consume events from external systems , and map the events to adhere to the associated stream. Sources receive events via multiple transports and in various data formats, and direct them into streams for processing. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.input.source.Source . Example : @source(type='source_type', static.option.key1='static_option_value1') To configure a stream that consumes events via a source, add the source configuration to a stream definition by adding the @source annotation with the required parameter values. The source syntax is as above Store You can use Store extension type to work with data/events stored in various data stores through the table abstraction . You can find more information about these extension types under the heading 'Extension types' in this document. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.table.record.AbstractRecordTable . Script Scripts allow you to define a function operation that is not provided in Siddhi core or its extension. It is not required to write an extension to define the function logic. Scripts allow you to write functions in other programming languages and execute them within Siddhi queries. Functions defined via scripts can be accessed in queries similar to any other inbuilt function. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.function.Script . Source Mapper Each @source configuration has a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that converts the incoming messages format to Siddhi events .The type parameter of the @map defines the map type to be used to map the data. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.SourceMapper . Example : @map(type='map_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') Sink Mapper Each @sink configuration has a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that converts the outgoing Siddhi events to configured messages format .The type parameter of the @map defines the map type to be used to map the data.

Minikube Google Kubernetes Engine(GKE) Cluster Docker for Mac Or any other Kubernetes cluster Admin privileges to install Siddhi operator Minikube Siddhi operator automatically creates NGINX ingress. Therefore it to work we can either enable ingress on Minikube using the following command. minikube addons enable ingress or disable Siddhi operator's automatically ingress creation . Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Cluster To install Siddhi operator, you have to give cluster admin permission to your account. In order to do that execute the following command (by replacing \"your-address@email.com\" with your account email address). kubectl create clusterrolebinding user-cluster-admin-binding \\ --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=your-address@email.com Docker for Mac Siddhi operator automatically creates NGINX ingress. Therefore it to work we can either enable ingress on Docker for mac following the official documentation or disable Siddhi operator's automatically ingress creation . Install Siddhi Operator To install the Siddhi Kubernetes operator run the following commands. kubectl apply -f https://github.com/siddhi-io/siddhi-operator/releases/download/v0.1.1/prerequisites.yaml kubectl apply -f https://github.com/siddhi-io/siddhi-operator/releases/download/v0.1.1/siddhi-operator.yaml You can verify the installation by making sure the following deployments are running in your Kubernetes cluster. $ kubectl get deployment NAME DESIRED CURRENT UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE siddhi-operator 1 1 1 1 1m siddhi-parser 1 1 1 1 1m Using a custom-built siddhi-runner image If you need to use a custom-built siddhi-runner image for all the SiddhiProcess deployments, you have to configure SIDDHI_RUNNER_IMAGE and SIDDHI_RUNNER_IMAGE_TAG environment variables with the custom-built image name and image tag respectively in the siddhi-operator.yaml file. Refer the documentation on creating custom siddhi-runner images bundling additional JARs here . If you are pulling the custom-built image from a private Docker registry/repository, specify the corresponding kubernetes secret as SIDDHI_RUNNER_IMAGE_SECRET environment variable in the siddhi-operator.yaml file. For more details on using docker images from private registries/repositories refer this documentation . Deploy and run Siddhi App Siddhi applications can be deployed on Kubernetes using the Siddhi operator. Here we will creating a very simple Siddhi stream processing application that consumes events via HTTP, filers the input events on the type 'monitored' and logs the output on the console. This can be created using a SiddhiProcess YAML file as given below. Siddhi Tooling You can also use the powerful Siddhi Editor to implement and test steam processing applications. Configuring Siddhi To configure databases, extensions, authentication, periodic state persistence, and statistics for Siddhi as Kubernetes Microservice refer Siddhi Config Guide . To deploy the above Siddhi app in your Kubernetes cluster, copy to a YAML file with name monitor-app.yaml and execute the following command. kubectl create -f absolute-yaml-file-path /monitor-app.yaml tls secret Within the SiddhiProcess, a tls secret named siddhi-tls is configured. If a Kubernetes secret with the same name does not exist in the Kubernetes cluster, the NGINX will ignore it and use a self-generated certificate. Configuring a secret will be necessary for calling HTTPS endpoints, refer deploy and run Siddhi apps with HTTPS section for more details. If the monitor-app is deployed successfully, the created SiddhiProcess, deployment, service, and ingress can be viewed as follows. $ kubectl get SiddhiProcesses NAME AGE monitor-app 2m $ kubectl get deployment NAME DESIRED CURRENT UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE monitor-app 1 1 1 1 1m siddhi-operator 1 1 1 1 1m siddhi-parser 1 1 1 1 1m $ kubectl get service NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE kubernetes ClusterIP 10.96.0.1 none 443/TCP 10d monitor-app ClusterIP 10.101.242.132 none 8280/TCP 1m siddhi-operator ClusterIP 10.111.138.250 none 8383/TCP 1m siddhi-parser LoadBalancer 10.102.172.142 pending 9090:31830/TCP 1m $ kubectl get ingress NAME HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE siddhi siddhi 10.0.2.15 80, 443 1m Using a custom-built siddhi-runner image If you need to use a custom-built siddhi-runner image for a specific SiddhiProcess deployment, you have to configure image and imageTag arguments with the custom-built image name and image tag respectively in the monitor-app.yaml file. Refer the documentation on creating custom siddhi-runner images bundling additional JARs here . If you are pulling the custom-built image from a private Docker registry/repository, specify the corresponding kubernetes secret as imagePullSecret argument in the monitor-app.yaml file. For more details on using docker images from private registries/repositories refer this documentation . Invoke Siddhi Applications To invoke the Siddhi App, first obtain the external IP of the ingress load balancer using kubectl get ingress command as follows. $ kubectl get ingress NAME HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE siddhi siddhi 10.0.2.15 80, 443 1m Then, add the host siddhi and related external IP ( ADDRESS ) to the /etc/hosts file in your machine. Minikube For Minikube, you have to use Minikube IP as the external IP. Hence, run minikube ip command to get the IP of the Minikube cluster. Docker for Mac For Docker for Mac, you have to use 0.0.0.0 as the external IP. Use the following CURL command to send events to monitor-app deployed in Kubernetes. curl -X POST \\ https://siddhi/monitor-app/8280/example \\ -H Content-Type: application/json \\ -d { type : monitored , deviceID : 001 , power : 341 } -k Note: Here -k option is used to turn off curl's verification of the certificate. View Siddhi Process Logs Since the output of monitor-app is logged, you can see the output by monitoring the associated pod's logs. To find the monitor-app pod use the kubectl get pods command. This will list down all the deployed pods. $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE monitor-app-7f8584875f-krz6t 1/1 Running 0 2m siddhi-operator-8589c4fc69-6xbtx 1/1 Running 0 2m siddhi-parser-64d4cd86ff-pfq2s 1/1 Running 0 2m Here, the pod starting with the SiddhiProcess name (in this case monitor-app- ) is the pod we need to monitor.

Through this you can also run multiple Siddhi Apps in a single SiddhiProcess. This can be done by passing the configmaps containing Siddhi app files to the SiddhiProcess's apps configuration as follows. apps: - config-map-name1 - config-map-name2 Sample on deploying and running Siddhi Apps via configmaps Here we will creating a very simple Siddhi application as follows, that consumes events via HTTP, filers the input events on type 'monitored' and logs the output on the console. Siddhi Tooling You can also use the powerful Siddhi Editor to implement and test steam processing applications. Save the above Siddhi App file as MonitorApp.siddhi , and use this file to create a Kubernetes config map with the name monitor-app-cm . This can be achieved by running the following command. kubectl create configmap monitor-app-cm --from-file= absolute-file-path /MonitorApp.siddhi The created config map can be added to SiddhiProcess YAML under the apps entry as follows. Save the YAML file as monitor-app.yaml , and use the following command to deploy the SiddhiProcess. kubectl create -f absolute-yaml-file-path /monitor-app.yaml Using a config, created from a directory containing multiple Siddhi files SiddhiProcess's apps configuration also supports a config map that is created from a directory containing multiple Siddhi files. Use kubectl create configmap siddhi-apps --from-file= DIRECTORY_PATH command to create a config map from a directory. Invoke Siddhi Applications To invoke the Siddhi Apps, first obtain the external IP of the ingress load balancer using kubectl get ingress command as follows. $ kubectl get ingress NAME HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE siddhi siddhi 10.0.2.15 80, 443 1m Then, add the host siddhi and related external IP ( ADDRESS ) to the /etc/hosts file in your machine. Minikube For Minikube, you have to use Minikube IP as the external IP. Hence, run minikube ip command to get the IP of the Minikube cluster. Use the following CURL command to send events to monitor-app deployed in Kubernetes. curl -X POST \\ https://siddhi/monitor-app/8280/example \\ -H Content-Type: application/json \\ -d { type : monitored , deviceID : 001 , power : 341 } -k Note: Here -k option is used to turn off curl's verification of the certificate. View Siddhi Process Logs Since the output of monitor-app is logged, you can see the output by monitoring the associated pod's logs. To find the monitor-app pod use the kubectl get pods command.

If you need to disable automatic ingress creation, you have to change the AUTO_INGRESS_CREATION value in the Siddhi operator.yaml file to false or null as below. Deploy and run Siddhi App with HTTPS Configuring tls will allow Siddhi ingress NGINX to expose HTTPS endpoints of your Siddhi Apps. To do so, created a Kubernetes secret and add that to the SiddhiProcess's tls configuration as following. tls: ingressSecret: siddhi-tls Sample on deploying and running Siddhi App with HTTPS First, you need to create a certificate using the following commands. For more details about the certificate creation refers this . openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout siddhi.key -out siddhi.crt -subj /CN=siddhi/O=siddhi After that, create a kubernetes secret called siddhi-tls , which we intended to add to the TLS configurations using the following command. kubectl create secret tls siddhi-tls --key siddhi.key --cert siddhi.crt The created secret then need to be added to the created SiddhiProcess's tls configuration as following. When this is done Siddhi operator will now enable TLS support via the NGINX ingress, and you will be able to access all the HTTPS endpoints. Invoke Siddhi Applications You can use now send the events to following HTTPS endpoint. https://siddhi/monitor-app/8280/example Further, you can use the following CURL command to send a request to the deployed siddhi applications via HTTPS. curl --cacert siddhi.crt -X POST \\ https://siddhi/monitor-app/8280/example \\ -H Content-Type: application/json \\ -d { type : monitored , deviceID : 001 , power : 341 } View Siddhi Process Logs The output logs show the event that you sent using the previous CURL command. $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE monitor-app-667c97c898-rrtfs 1/1 Running 0 2m siddhi-operator-79dcc45959-fkk4d 1/1 Running 0 3m siddhi-parser-64d4cd86ff-k8b87 1/1 Running 0 3m $ kubectl logs monitor-app-667c97c898-rrtfs JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to /opt/java/openjdk CARBON_HOME environment variable is set to /home/siddhi_user/siddhi-runner-0.1.0 RUNTIME_HOME environment variable is set to /home/siddhi_user/siddhi-runner-0.1.0/wso2/runner Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap [2019-05-06 5:36:54,894] INFO {org.wso2.carbon.launcher.extensions.OSGiLibBundleDeployerUtils updateOSGiLib} - Successfully updated the OSGi bundle information of Carbon Runtime: runner osgi [2019-05-06 05:36:57,692] INFO {org.wso2.msf4j.internal.websocket.WebSocketServerSC} - All required capabilities are available of WebSocket service component is available.

Here we will creating a very simple Siddhi stream processing application that consumes events via HTTP, filers the input events on the type 'monitored' and logs the output on the console. This can be created using a SiddhiProcess YAML file as given below. Siddhi Tooling You can also use the powerful Siddhi Editor to implement and test steam processing applications. Configuring Siddhi To configure databases, extensions, authentication, periodic state persistence, and statistics for Siddhi as Kubernetes Microservice refer Siddhi Config Guide . To deploy the above Siddhi app in your Kubernetes cluster, copy to a YAML file with name monitor-app.yaml and execute the following command. kubectl create -f absolute-yaml-file-path /monitor-app.yaml tls secret Within the SiddhiProcess, a tls secret named siddhi-tls is configured. If a Kubernetes secret with the same name does not exist in the Kubernetes cluster, the NGINX will ignore it and use a self-generated certificate. Configuring a secret will be necessary for calling HTTPS endpoints, refer deploy and run Siddhi apps with HTTPS section for more details. If the monitor-app is deployed successfully, the created SiddhiProcess, deployment, service, and ingress can be viewed as follows. $ kubectl get SiddhiProcesses NAME AGE monitor-app 2m $ kubectl get deployment NAME DESIRED CURRENT UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE monitor-app 1 1 1 1 1m siddhi-operator 1 1 1 1 1m siddhi-parser 1 1 1 1 1m $ kubectl get service NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE kubernetes ClusterIP 10.96.0.1 none 443/TCP 10d monitor-app ClusterIP 10.101.242.132 none 8280/TCP 1m siddhi-operator ClusterIP 10.111.138.250 none 8383/TCP 1m siddhi-parser LoadBalancer 10.102.172.142 pending 9090:31830/TCP 1m $ kubectl get ingress NAME HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE siddhi siddhi 10.0.2.15 80, 443 1m Using a custom-built siddhi-runner image If you need to use a custom-built siddhi-runner image for a specific SiddhiProcess deployment, you have to configure image and imageTag arguments with the custom-built image name and image tag respectively in the monitor-app.yaml file. Refer the documentation on creating custom siddhi-runner images bundling additional JARs here . If you are pulling the custom-built image from a private Docker registry/repository, specify the corresponding kubernetes secret as imagePullSecret argument in the monitor-app.yaml file. For more details on using docker images from private registries/repositories refer this documentation . Invoke Siddhi Applications To invoke the Siddhi App, first obtain the external IP of the ingress load balancer using kubectl get ingress command as follows. $ kubectl get ingress NAME HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE siddhi siddhi 10.0.2.15 80, 443 1m Then, add the host siddhi and related external IP ( ADDRESS ) to the /etc/hosts file in your machine. Minikube For Minikube, you have to use Minikube IP as the external IP. Hence, run minikube ip command to get the IP of the Minikube cluster. Docker for Mac For Docker for Mac, you have to use 0.0.0.0 as the external IP. Use the following CURL command to send events to monitor-app deployed in Kubernetes. curl -X POST \\ https://siddhi/monitor-app/8280/example \\ -H Content-Type: application/json \\ -d { type : monitored , deviceID : 001 , power : 341 } -k Note: Here -k option is used to turn off curl's verification of the certificate. View Siddhi Process Logs Since the output of monitor-app is logged, you can see the output by monitoring the associated pod's logs. To find the monitor-app pod use the kubectl get pods command. This will list down all the deployed pods. $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE monitor-app-7f8584875f-krz6t 1/1 Running 0 2m siddhi-operator-8589c4fc69-6xbtx 1/1 Running 0 2m siddhi-parser-64d4cd86ff-pfq2s 1/1 Running 0 2m Here, the pod starting with the SiddhiProcess name (in this case monitor-app- ) is the pod we need to monitor.

Download the latest Siddhi Runner distribution Unzip the siddhi-runner-x.x.x.zip Start SiddhiApps with the runner config by executing the following commands from the distribution directory Linux/Mac : ./bin/runner.sh -Dapps= siddhi-file -Dconfig= config-yaml-file Windows : bin\\runner.bat -Dapps= siddhi-file -Dconfig= config-yaml-file Running Multiple SiddhiApps in one runner. To run multiple SiddhiApps in one runtime, have all SiddhiApps in a directory and pass its location through -Dapps parameter as follows, -Dapps= siddhi-apps-directory Always use absolute path for SiddhiApps and runner configs. Providing absolute path of SiddhiApp file, or directory in -Dapps parameter, and when providing the Siddhi runner config yaml on -Dconfig parameter while starting Siddhi runner. Siddhi Tooling You can also use the powerful Siddhi Editor to implement and test steam processing applications. Configuring Siddhi To configure databases, extensions, authentication, periodic state persistence, and statistics for Siddhi as Local Microservice refer Siddhi Config Guide . Samples Running Siddhi App Following SiddhiApp collects events via HTTP and logs the number of events arrived during last 15 seconds. Copy the above SiddhiApp, and create the SiddhiApp file CountOverTime.siddhi . Run the SiddhiApp by executing following commands from the distribution directory Linux/Mac : ./bin/runner.sh -Dapps= absolute-siddhi-file-path /CountOverTime.siddhi Windows : bin\\runner.bat -Dapps= absolute-siddhi-file-path \\CountOverTime.siddhi Test the SiddhiApp by calling the HTTP endpoint using curl or Postman as follows Publish events with curl command: Publish few json to the http endpoint as follows, curl -X POST http://localhost:8006/production \\ --header \"Content-Type:application/json\" \\ -d '{\"event\":{\"name\":\"Cake\",\"amount\":20.12}}' Publish events with Postman: Install 'Postman' application from Chrome web store Launch the application Make a 'Post' request to 'http://localhost:8006/production' endpoint. Set the Content-Type to 'application/json' and set the request body in json format as follows, { \"event\": { \"name\": \"Cake\", \"amount\": 20.12 } } Runner logs the total count on the console. Note, how the count increments with every event sent.

Following SiddhiApp collects events via HTTP and store them in H2 Database. The runner config can by configured with the relevant datasource information and passed when starting the runner Copy the above SiddhiApp, & config yaml, and create corresponding the SiddhiApp file ConsumeAndStore.siddhi and TestDb.yaml files. Run the SiddhiApp by executing following commands from the distribution directory Linux/Mac : ./bin/runner.sh -Dapps= absolute-siddhi-file-path /ConsumeAndStore.siddhi \\ -Dconfig= absolute-config-yaml-path /TestDb.yaml Windows : bin\\runner.sh -Dapps= absolute-siddhi-file-path \\ConsumeAndStore.siddhi ^ -Dconfig= absolute-config-yaml-path \\TestDb.yaml Test the SiddhiApp by calling the HTTP endpoint using curl or Postman as follows Publish events with curl command: Publish few json to the http endpoint as follows, curl -X POST http://localhost:8006/production \\ --header \"Content-Type:application/json\" \\ -d '{\"event\":{\"name\":\"Cake\",\"amount\":20.12}}' Publish events with Postman: Install 'Postman' application from Chrome web store Launch the application Make a 'Post' request to 'http://localhost:8006/production' endpoint. Set the Content-Type to 'application/json' and set the request body in json format as follows, { \"event\": { \"name\": \"Cake\", \"amount\": 20.12 } } Query Siddhi Store APIs to retrieve 10 records from the table. Query stored events with curl command: Publish few json to the http endpoint as follows, curl -X POST https://localhost:9443/stores/query \\ -H \"content-type: application/json\" \\ -u \"admin:admin\" \\ -d '{\"appName\" : \"ConsumeAndStore\", \"query\" : \"from ProductionTable select * limit 10;\" }' -k Query stored events with Postman: Install 'Postman' application from Chrome web store Launch the application Make a 'Post' request to 'https://localhost:9443/stores/query' endpoint. Set the Content-Type to 'application/json' and set the request body in json format as follows, { \"appName\" : \"ConsumeAndStore\", \"query\" : \"from ProductionTable select * limit 10;\" } The results of the query will be as follows, { \"records\":[ [\"Cake\",20.12] ] } Running with environmental/system variables Templating SiddhiApps allows users to provide environment/system variables to siddhiApps at runtime. This can help users to migrate SiddhiApps from one environment to another (E.g from dev, test and to prod). Following templated SiddhiApp collects events via HTTP, filters them based on amount greater than a given threshold value, and only sends the filtered events via email. Here the THRESHOLD value, and TO_EMAIL are templated in the TemplatedFilterAndEmail.siddhi SiddhiApp. The runner config is configured with a gmail account to send email messages in EmailConfig.yaml by templating sending EMAIL_ADDRESS , EMAIL_USERNAME and EMAIL_PASSWORD . Copy the above SiddhiApp, & config yaml, and create corresponding the SiddhiApp file TemplatedFilterAndEmail.siddhi and EmailConfig.yaml files. Set environment variables by running following in the termial Siddhi is about to run: export THRESHOLD=20 export TO_EMAIL= to email address export EMAIL_ADDRESS= gmail address export EMAIL_USERNAME= gmail username export EMAIL_PASSWORD= gmail password Or they can also be passed as system variables by adding -DTHRESHOLD=20 -DTO_EMAIL= to email address -DEMAIL_ADDRESS= gmail address -DEMAIL_USERNAME= gmail username -DEMAIL_PASSWORD= gmail password to the end of the runner startup script. Run the SiddhiApp by executing following commands from the distribution directory Linux/Mac : ./bin/runner.sh -Dapps= absolute-file-path /TemplatedFilterAndEmail.siddhi \\ -Dconfig= absolute-config-yaml-path /EmailConfig.yaml Windows : bin\\runner.bat -Dapps= absolute-file-path \\TemplatedFilterAndEmail.siddhi ^ -Dconfig= absolute-config-yaml-path \\EmailConfig.yaml Test the SiddhiApp by calling the HTTP endpoint using curl or Postman as follows Publish events with curl command: Publish few json to the http endpoint as follows, curl -X POST http://localhost:8006/production \\ --header \"Content-Type:application/json\" \\ -d '{\"event\":{\"name\":\"Cake\",\"amount\":2000.0}}' Publish events with Postman: Install 'Postman' application from Chrome web store Launch the application Make a 'Post' request to 'http://localhost:8006/production' endpoint.
