A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key.\nWhen performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period.\nTo have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nsession(\nINT|LONG|TIME\n window.session, \nSTRING\n window.key, \nINT|LONG|TIME\n window.allowedlatency)\n\n\n\n\n\nQUERY PARAMETERS\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \nName\n\n        \nDescription\n\n        \nDefault Value\n\n        \nPossible Data Types\n\n        \nOptional\n\n        \nDynamic\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nwindow.session\n\n        \nThe time period for which the session considered is valid.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key.\nWhen performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period.\nTo have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nsession(\nINT|LONG|TIME\n window.session, \nSTRING\n window.key, \nINT|LONG|TIME\n window.allowedlatency)\n\n\n\n\n\nQUERY PARAMETERS\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \nName\n\n        \nDescription\n\n        \nDefault Value\n\n        \nPossible Data Types\n\n        \nOptional\n\n        \nDynamic\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nwindow.session\n\n        \nThe time period for which the session considered is valid.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key.\nWhen performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period.\nTo have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nsession(\nINT|LONG|TIME\n window.session, \nSTRING\n window.key, \nINT|LONG|TIME\n window.allowedlatency)\n\n\n\n\n\nQUERY PARAMETERS\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \nName\n\n        \nDescription\n\n        \nDefault Value\n\n        \nPossible Data Types\n\n        \nOptional\n\n        \nDynamic\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nwindow.session\n\n        \nThe time period for which the session considered is valid.

A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key.\nWhen performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period.\nTo have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nsession(\nINT|LONG|TIME\n window.session, \nSTRING\n window.key, \nINT|LONG|TIME\n window.allowedlatency)\n\n\n\n\n\nQUERY PARAMETERS\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \nName\n\n        \nDescription\n\n        \nDefault Value\n\n        \nPossible Data Types\n\n        \nOptional\n\n        \nDynamic\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nwindow.session\n\n        \nThe time period for which the session considered is valid.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key.\nWhen performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period.\nTo have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nsession(\nINT|LONG|TIME\n window.session, \nSTRING\n window.key, \nINT|LONG|TIME\n window.allowedlatency)\n\n\n\n\n\nQUERY PARAMETERS\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \nName\n\n        \nDescription\n\n        \nDefault Value\n\n        \nPossible Data Types\n\n        \nOptional\n\n        \nDynamic\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nwindow.session\n\n        \nThe time period for which the session considered is valid.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key.\nWhen performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period.\nTo have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nsession(\nINT|LONG|TIME\n window.session, \nSTRING\n window.key, \nINT|LONG|TIME\n window.allowedlatency)\n\n\n\n\n\nQUERY PARAMETERS\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \nName\n\n        \nDescription\n\n        \nDefault Value\n\n        \nPossible Data Types\n\n        \nOptional\n\n        \nDynamic\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nwindow.session\n\n        \nThe time period for which the session considered is valid.
